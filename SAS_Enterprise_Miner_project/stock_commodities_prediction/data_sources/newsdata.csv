The producer last week agreed to buy stakes in two offshore fields in Brazil, further expanding its Americas portfolio.“There is a lot of new opportunity for us in that part of the world,” Wan Zulkiflee said in an interview Friday on the 83rd floor of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, adding that the shifting focus doesn’t mean the company is leaving its home country. Petronas still has “many more projects lined up” in Malaysia, including plans to boost spending on renewable energy, he said.Petronas typically allocates RM45 billion (US$10.9 billion) to 55 billion ringgit on capital expenditure every year and upstream projects will have “a bigger chunk” of that going forward, Wan Zulkiflee said. One of those to get a slice of the spending boost will be a liquefied natural gas export venture in western Canada with Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Drilling BoostPetronas last year agreed to buy a 25% stake in the C$40 billion LNG Canada project. Construction costs will increase over the next few years and Petronas will need to boost spending on gas drilling, Wan Zulkiflee said. The company also plans to invest US$2.3 billion over four years in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale oil fields with state-controlled YPF SA, and has interests in 10 offshore blocks in Mexico. Drilling in Mexico will begin in the third quarter.The purchase of stakes in Brazilian oil fields from Petroleo Brasileiro SA for US$1.29 billion will bring commitments for more spending as the companies drill to boost production, Wan Zulkiflee said. Still, more spending doesn’t mean more borrowing. The company has no plans to tap the bond market and is cash-rich, he said. Petronas had RM172.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents as at Dec 31, according to its latest financial statement.Petronas is also looking to build up its renewable business. The company made its first foray into cleaner energy this month after agreeing to buy Amplus Energy Solutions Pte from I Squared Capital, amassing 500 megawatts of solar power in operation or under development.Petronas plans to set aside as much as 5% of its annual capex toward this segment and will be looking at further opportunities in Malaysia, focusing on solar and wind, Wan Zulkiflee said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/petronas-looks-americas-increase-oil-reserves,"2019-05-01 20:02:57"

Malaysia struck a deal with China to resume the East Coast Rail Link at a lower cost and revived the US$34 billion property and transport hub Bandar Malaysia.“Fiscal stimulus, per resurrection of ECRL and Bandar Malaysia projects, is returning, oil prices are exceeding target and liquidity is ample,” the bank said in the report. “Government policy-centric catalytic news flow alone could allow the KLCI to recover to 12-month highs of 1,850.”Macquarie expects similar developments to happen with MRT 3 and the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail project, as well as in the telecom sector and within the Petroliam Nasional Bhd group of companies.The KLCI is showing some signs of a revival.

Other than Gebeng, PetGas also operates similar facilities in Kerteh, to serve the Kerteh Integrated Petrochemical Complex.“The contract extension is a testimony to our customers’ confidence in us to provide a reliable supply of power at a competitive tariff from PetGas’s cogen plant in Gebeng,” said PetGas managing director/chief executive officer Kamal Bahrin Ahmad.In addition to the utilities business, PetGas operates two regasification terminals which are strategically located in the Straits of Johor and in Melaka, namely the Regasification Terminal Pengerang and the Regasification Terminal Sungai Udang, respectively.

The three-year contract commenced on April 15, and comes with the option for a one-year extension.An analyst who did not want to be named told The Edge Financial Daily that the group had won the project in part because its manufacturing facilities are close to the Rapid project.“The reason why CCM got it [the contract] was by virtue of their location. Their [CCM’s] factory is in Pasir Gudang, Johor, versus the other competitor which is based in Ipoh,” said the analyst.Malaysia is a net importer of caustic soda, he said, adding demand for the chemical would only increase because of Rapid’s demand. As more refinery operations are opened at the site, demand for the substance is likely to be further enhanced.In an April 23 note, Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) said Rapid would require more caustic soda ahead of its anticipated ramp up in 2021, and that the demand would be progressive in nature as it is tied to the gradual increase in operations at the site.“This increase [in demand] is expected to widen the domestic supply gap from 142,000 tonnes per annum currently to 300,000 tonnes per annum by 2021 without taking into account the organic growth of existing industries,” said HLIB.The analyst said that the volume that Petronas contracted out is basically 150,000 tonnes per annum — the equivalent of total average annual caustic soda imports.HLIB said in its note that CCM has secured a back-to-back agreement with a commodities trading giant from North Asia to commit the contracted supply.On the contract’s impact on CCM’s earnings, the analyst said “snippets” of the project’s impacts would be seen in the second half of the financial year 2019 (2HFY19), and that more significant impacts would be seen in FY20.Contributions from the contract would only trickle in this year, he indicated, noting the recent explosion at the Rapid development on April 12 could delay the “ramping up” progress.In its note, HLIB said CCM is currently operating its Pasir Gudang Works 2 plant, which has a capacity of 80,000 tonnes a year. It is planning to reinstate its first plant, which would provide an approximate 50% increase in capacity as the facility can produce about 40,000 tonnes a year.The analyst projected prices for the chemical at US$500 (RM2,065) a tonne for FY19 and said as long as caustic soda prices do not suffer from a dramatic drop, the group would turn a profit.“The cost of production is in ringgit, but they (CCM) sell in US dollars, so their margins are good,” the analyst added, noting CCM’s lower production costs, compared with its regional peers, will benefit it in the future.CCM’s net profit in FY18 was flat at RM25.71 million on revenues of RM395.94 million. According to Bloomberg, the consensus earnings estimates for FY19 is RM39.7 million, and for FY20, RM43.2 million.The analyst maintains more attention should be paid to CCM because it provides chemicals to a wide variety of industries, especially rubber gloves.“CCM remains an underappreciated proxy to the glove sector and the Rapid integrated petroleum complex,” said HLIB, which says the target price for CCM is RM3.08 based on FY19-FY20 price-earnings ratio of 8.6 times to 7.9 times, with an implied dividend yield of 5.8% to 6.3%CCM is currently trading at about RM2.10, valuing the company at RM352.16 million.Its 52-week-high was RM2.35, and its low RM1.55.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ccm-right-place-and-time-rapid,"2019-05-01 20:02:59"

(April 25, 57 sen)
Maintain outperform with a target price (TP) of 69 sen. Financial year 2019 (FY19) net profit of RM47.6 million came in above expectations at 106% of our, and 109% of consensus, full-year earnings forecasts, due to better-than-expected operating margins. The company has proposed dividends of one sen per share, bringing its full-year cash dividends for FY19 to 1.5 sen per share (excluding share dividend of one treasury share for every 100 existing shares announced during its third quarter of the financial year 2019 [3QFY19] results) — above our expectations of one sen per share for the full year. 
FY19 net profit saw a flattish 1% growth, with a 31% drop from its manufacturing segment due to its US shipment suspensions, but mitigated by a 23% growth in its trading segment.For  the fourth quarter of the financial year 2019 (4QFY19), net profit of RM11.5 million was also flattish year-on-year (y-o-y), despite a 5% drop in revenue, helped by higher margin for its trading segment (14% versus 11%). Sequentially, the quarter posted a mild 3% growth in net profit quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), in-line with its 2% revenue growth.The company is still facing a shipment suspension for its carbon steel butt-weld fittings to the US following a preliminary affirmative anti-circumvention determination in July 2018. However, we gathered that the US Department of Commerce (DoC) had concluded their verifications on Pantech in late-February, and hence, we form our base-case assumption that the suspension will be uplifted before the second half of 2020 (2H20). Additionally, the group is also expected to be a beneficiary of increased offshore fabrication works locally, driven by Petroliam Nasional Bhd’s (Petronas) increasing upstream capex, given that it is the only locally-owned pipe supplier under the Petronas Framework Agreement.Post-results, we raised our earnings for the financial year 2020 (FY20E) core net profit by 6% after slightly increasing our operating margins assumptions, while also introducing FY21E numbers.The unchanged TP of 69 sen is pegged to 0.9 times price-to-book value (PBV) on FY20E. Our ascribed valuation is close to its average PBV of one time, implying 12-13 times price-to-earnings ratio (also close to average).All told, we continue to like Pantech on the back of its potential earnings visibility restoration story, underpinned by the uplifting of its US shipment suspension, and sales growth driven by local fabrication projects.Risks to our call include: i) slower-than-expected trading volumes; ii) lower-than-expected manufacturing utilisation; and iii) delayed positive outcome from the DoC action. — Kenanga Research, April 25",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/pantech-benefit-expected-lifting-us-shipment-suspension,"2019-05-01 20:03:00"

It also plans to spend on setting up 10 new petrol stations, said PetDag managing director and chief executive officer Datuk Seri Syed Zainal Abidin.“We are currently leading the market [in terms of number of petrol stations] with about 1,057 stations.“We already have a substantial land bank. Now it is a matter of how to operationalise land bank. So we are looking at about 10 new stations [this year]. Last year, we did about 12 [new stations],” he told reporters after the group’s annual general meeting here yesterday.In 2018, PetDag’s retail business embarked on aggressive asset refreshing efforts, as it transformed the ambience of 300 Petronas stations and 100 Mesra convenience stores nationwide, on top of the opening of 12 new stations.On whether PetDag plans to dispose of its less profitable stations, chairman Datuk Md Arif Mahmood said rationalisation has always been part of the group’s strategy. However, profit is not the group’s sole consideration.“If you look at some of the areas that we serve; they are not served by other companies because that’s part of the way of Petronas. It’s not just about profits. It’s profits and the well-being of the people we serve,” he said.On a separate matter, Md Arif said the price ceiling on retail fuel price under the automatic pricing mechanism has helped provide stability for its dealers, consumers as well as oil companies.“That price stability is actually pretty good. The feedback we got from our dealers is that it has helped them in managing their cash flow,” he said.For PetDag, its margin on retail fuel is fixed. Md Arif said the net margin was set by the government under the automatic pricing mechanism and has not been revised for the last eight to nine years.“So the only way we can make more profit is by getting more efficient in managing our inventory,” he said.As to whether the potential RON95 price cap removal would affect the company, Syed Zainal Abidin said PetDag is in a good position if a targeted fuel subsidy programme for the B40 group is introduced. He said this is because its customers are predominantly from that income group as it has the biggest network of petrol stations in the country.“So it will benefit us, that is what we presume. [But] we are still waiting for the announcement of the fuel subsidy programme. It is too early to say because the mechanism has not been announced,” he added.Earlier this week, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the cap on the RON95 price, currently at RM2.08, might be removed when a new petrol subsidy for Bantuan Sara Hidup recipients comes into effect.Without government subsidies, RON95 pump prices this week would have been RM2.50.

(April 23, 31.5 sen)
Downgrade to hold with an unchanged target price (TP) of 32 sen: Velesto Energy announced on Monday that Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd had awarded it four contracts that may keep the Naga 2, Naga 3, Naga 5 and Naga 6 occupied for three years each until 2022 forecasts. Each contract is firmly for a year, followed by two annual renewal options. The contracts for Naga 2, Naga 3 and Naga 5 will commence in April or May 2019, and the Naga 6 contract from June or July 2019. These contracts are notable because they marked the return of long-term contracts — a rarity since the start of the 2014 oil price downturn. 
The average daily charter rate (DCR) for the Naga 2 and Naga 3 contracts is US$69,700 (RM287,861), the Naga 5 contract (US$71,700), and the Naga 6 contract (US$75,700). The average DCR for all four contracts is US$71,700, representing a 2% to 5% hike from the average DCR of US$68,000 to US$70,000 per day of contracts awarded in 2018. The higher DCRs suggest Petronas is willing to provide a stronger support to its domestic service champions, sharing the benefits of stronger oil prices.Separately, Petronas may have also agreed to pay Velesto Energy for rig mobilisation and demobilisation costs, suggesting the contract terms may be even better. On the other hand, we believe that “zero-rate” periods would continue to apply to the said contracts, meaning Velesto Energy would not be paid if the rigs were not performing actual drilling work during the time-charter period, although Velesto Energy may have succeeded in negotiating for a cap to the duration of the “zero-rate” periods.Assuming an uninterrupted time charter, and a full exercise of the option periods, we estimate Velesto Energy’s utilisation rates for its seven-strong jack-up rig fleet would rise to 83% for financial year 2019 (FY19F) and 77% for FY20F. However, if we assumed each contract year would entail a 60-day “zero-rate” period, the utilisation rates would fall to 74% for FY19F and 67% for FY20F, based on contracts secured to date. This is on track to achieve our 80% utilisation assumption for all forecast years.Meanwhile, the average DCR for contracts in hand is US$71,000, more or less in line with our US$70,000 per day forecast. Based on contracts in hand, we expect Velesto Energy’s first half of 2019 forecast (1H19F) utilisation rate to average at 71% versus 62% for 1H18, and 2H19F utilisation may rise to 95% versus 83% in 2H18. For FY19F, we estimate the utilisation is set to reach 83%, exceeding FY18’s 73%. — CGSCIMB Research, April 23",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/four-new-contracts-likely-keep-velesto-energy-busy-until-2022,"2019-05-01 20:03:06"

Maintain buy with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM3.08: Chemical Company of Malaysia (CCM) announced that it had accepted the letter of award from Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) for the supply of caustic soda to Petronas Refinery and Petrochemical Corp Sdn Bhd. 
The contract is based on Petronas’ required demand, estimated to be up to a maximum volume of 351,000 tonnes. Based on current market prices, pricing mechanism and other terms and conditions, the contract value is estimated to be at RM351.9 million for the primary period of three years from April 15, 2019 until April 14, 2022 with a one-year extension option.We are positive on this announcement. Although an open secret, CCM’s clinching of the job highlights the resolve of their turnaround story and insatiable hunger to participate in one of the new economic engines of Malaysia that is the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) in Pengerang, Johor.In oil and gas refining, caustic soda is used in the extraction of sulphur, sulphur compounds and acids. We understand that demand from Rapid alone is about 150,000 to 160,000 tonnes per annum at full ramp-up — anticipated by 2021. This increase is expected to widen the domestic supply gap from 142,000 tonnes per annum currently to 300,000 tonnes per annum by 2021 without taking into account organic growth of existing industries.We understand that Rapid’s demand for caustic soda is progressive and in tandem with the commissioning and ramp-up of its refineries. As such, we estimate that in financial year 2019 (FY19) the volumes required will be relatively small before a ramp-up in orders in FY20. It is understood that the pricing mechanism is referenced to the market plus a discount. CCM only has an about 80,000 tonnes per annum capacity at this juncture (from Pasir Gudang Work 2 or PGW2) before a further 40,000 tonnes per annum will be reactivated in the second half of this year via PGW1.To cater for this contract, CCM has secured a back-to-back agreement with a commodity trading giant from North Asia to commit to the contracted supply.While this news is positive, we opt for a conservative stance in our earnings forecasts. As it is, our projections have already made CCM a compelling turnaround story worthy of investing in.Our TP is a function of FY19 forecast earnings per share of 23.7 sen pegged at a price-earnings multiple of 13 times. The stock is currently trading at an attractive FY19-FY20 price-earnings ratio of 8.6 times-7.9 times with an implied dividend yield of 5.8%-6.3%. CCM remains an underappreciated proxy for the glove sector and Rapid’s Integrated Petroleum Complex.

The Australian producer signed a heads of agreement with China's ENN Group in April on such a deal, as it markets gas from its proposed Scarborough project.Also, Russia's Novatek is selling 50% of its volumes from its Arctic LNG 2 project on a spot basis, which it says is driven partly by the emergence of portfolio players.Developers are also increasingly taking final investment decisions on new projects without having firm sales agreements already in place.Shell decided to go ahead with its US$30 billion LNG Canada project last October with few buyers, while Exxon Mobil Corp and Qatar Petroleum committed to their Golden Pass LNG project in the United States without binding buyers to the total volume.But this potentially exposes projects to new pricing risks, and some portfolio players could be trying to mitigate these risks by increased trading in spot markets and by buying or selling cargoes using alternative pricing formulas.""The shift from long-term take-or-pay contracts to portfolio supply is placing greater risks on project sponsors and exacerbating the risks of oversupply,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note in April.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/glut-forces-lng-producers-offer-flexible-deals-global-portfolios,"2019-05-01 20:03:07"

The total amount raised in IPOs also plunged 91% to RM633.12 million — the lowest in 20 years — compared with 2017’s RM7.38 billion.Astramina Advisory Sdn Bhd managing director Wong Muh Rong says investors are still uncertain about Malaysia’s policies and ministers publicly airing their differences do not help matters.She cited the recent outburst involving Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Redzuan Md Yusof’s rebuke of his colleague Yeo Bee Yin, the minister of energy, science, technology, environment and climate change, over rare earths mining company Lynas Corp Ltd.“These sort of matters should be addressed in-house at Cabinet meetings,” Wong observes.An investment banker points out that companies are holding back on IPOs as they are afraid that they will not get the valuations they desire. “Bursa has been one of the worse performers in Asia year to date.”YTD, the FBM KLCI has fallen 2.9% to close at 1,641.81 points last Friday.Nevertheless, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s remarks at the two-day Invest Malaysia conference last month, suggesting Putrajaya could be looking to list mature government-linked entities, have stirred up some interest in the IPO market.“If you want to excite the IPO market [with the listing of government-linked companies], let’s do a really good one. We must pick something that Malaysia is good at, and Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is one of them,” says Astramina’s Wong.“Petronas is already run like an international public listed company, so it will have little trouble finding investors and proving its value,” she adds.Three of its units — Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and Petronas Dagangan Bhd — are already listed on Bursa, with their market capitalisation at RM72.8 billion, RM34.67 billion and RM24.84 billion respectively.However, a head of a local investment bank is sceptical of a public share sale of Petronas as the national oil company is considered a strategic asset to the government.Pointing to plans for the domestic and international listing of Saudi oil giant Aramco as well as China’s Sinopec Marketing Co, a subsidiary of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, Wong opines that a divestment of even a 30% to 40% stake would be sufficient to excite the IPO market.“The listing [of Petronas] may not be this year, but they can start working on the documentation for the IPO and then launch it once market conditions improve.”Wong expects more mergers and acquisitions and restructuring activities this year, but stresses, “We still need to see more progress in reform efforts by the [Pakatan Harapan-led] government after one year.”Investors are also keenly watching QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd’s IPO, which is set to be the country’s biggest listing since that of integrated petrochemical producer Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd, which raised RM4 billion in July 2017.QSR’s largest shareholder, Johor Corp, is seeking to raise as much as RM2 billion from the IPO, which could value the company at some RM6 billion.Johor Corp president and CEO Datuk Kamaruzzaman Abu Kassim said last May that private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) were looking to exit the fast-food operator.Initially slated for the first half of the year, the IPO may face further delays as its shareholders want higher valuations, a source close to the deal tells The Edge. The desire for richer valuations is telling, considering that QSR’s IPO has been planned since 2016.Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) data shows that QSR’s net profit grew 4.7% to RM192.59 million in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018), from RM183.95 million in FY2017. Revenue rose a marginal 1% to RM4.61 billion from RM4.56 billion in FY2017.According to investment bankers, the potential listing of other government-linked entities include Malayan Banking Bhd’s (Maybank) insurance arm Etiqa International Holdings Sdn Bhd (EIH), Axiata Group Bhd’s 62.37%-owned unit edotco Group Sdn Bhd, highway concessionaire Projek Lintasan Kota Holdings Sdn Bhd (Prolintas), Felcra Bhd and the Airport Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).It is understood that Maybank has started making preparations for a possible IPO of Etiqa, including seeking Bank Negara Malaysia’s approval.Maybank’s stake in Etiqa is parked under wholly-owned EIH, which has a 69.05% stake in Maybank Ageas Holdings Bhd, while Brussels-based insurer Ageas NV holds the remaining equity interest.A listing of Etiqa would certainly appeal to the market given its relative size and pedigree. Although EIH’s net profit fell 9% year on year to RM700.84 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, net interest income rose 6.4% y-o-y to RM1.16 billion last year.In an April report last year, CIMB Research pegged Etiqa’s market capitalisation upon listing at between RM5.3 billion and RM10.7 billion, based on a price-to-book value (P/BV) of 1.4 times to 2.8 times. It used Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd’s P/BV as a benchmark.Rumours of Maybank preparing to spin off and list Etiqa have been doing the rounds since 2016, however.At present, Etiqa is the clear leader in the general takaful segment with a market share of more than 50%. It ranks No 3 on the family takaful list, with a market share of 15%.“If you’re launching an IPO, you need to ensure that the company is market ready and the listing optimises the valuation for its shareholders,” says a senior director with a local investment bank, who declined to be named.“But there is liquidity on the side and investors are willing to pay for better assets. Personally, I’m thinking that more immediate [ones] could be things like the possible restructuring of Malaysia Airlines Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd because recent large-cap IPOs have disappointed.“I think the only one that possibly has the most traction could be the Airport REIT,” the senior director adds.Under Budget 2019, the government, being the asset owner of almost all commercial airports in Malaysia, had proposed to set up the world’s first Airport REIT. It had set a target of raising RM4 billion by selling a 30% stake in the REIT to private investment institutions.However, last November, the Malaysian Aviation Commission pointed out that the Airport REIT exercise will only be carried out after the regulated asset base framework and the user fee structure have been negotiated and finalised between the government and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd. That is slated to be completed this year.The idea to list Prolintas was first mooted in March 2017 by then Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) group chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, who had set an end-2018 to early 2019 target.However, investment bankers say a flotation of Prolintas, wholly owned by PNB, is unlikely to take place this year as the government needs to sort out its privatisation policy for highway tolls first.Based on SSM data, the highway concessionaire has been posting losses for the past five years, which widened to RM100.1 million in FY2017 compared with RM31.38 million in FY2016. Revenue, however, rose 58% y-o-y to RM317.41 million in FY2017.Thus, most investment bankers are of the view that the IPOs coming to market this year will be heavily geared towards private companies rather than government-linked entities. Big IPOs on the horizon are family-owned poultry group Leong Hup International Bhd and MR.DIY, the country’s biggest home improvement retailer.According to news reports, Leong Hup is looking to raise as much as US$600 million (RM2.49 billion) and MR.DIY, RM1.5 billion.Leong Hup posted a 7.5% y-o-y fall in net profit to RM247.41 million in FY2017, on a 4.6% rise in revenue to RM5.5 billion. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ipos-private-companies-drive-market-rebound-year,"2019-05-01 20:03:19"

They include the extension of an existing contract with Petronas Carigali and one new drilling for ExxonMobil, both in Malaysia.Sapura Energy also bagged a provision to install six subsea pipelines in the Gulf of Suez, marking its first foray into Egypt, as well as a submarine rescue service contract for the Royal Australian Navy and an engineering, procurement, construction and installation works in Indonesia.According to Bloomberg data, 11 out of 18 analysts observing the stock recommend a “buy” and the rest a “hold”.In a report yesterday, AmInvestment Research said it expected the new contracts to add 8% to Sapura Energy’s outstanding order book of RM18.5 billion.MIDF Research, which has a “neutral” view of Sapura Energy, said that it remained wary of the group’s earnings prospects as its drilling segment has yet to break even.Sapura Technology Sdn Bhd was announced to have pared down his stake in a stock exchange announcement by Sapura Energy to Bursa Malaysia last Friday.The shares changed hands through several off-market deals at 31 sen per share, according to Bloomberg data.

(April 12, RM8.84)
Maintain buy with an unchanged fair value (FV) of RM10.40: We maintain our “buy” recommendation on Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (PetChem) with an unchanged FV of RM10.40 a share based on unchanged financial year 2019 forecast (FY19F) enterprise value (EV)/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of 10 times — three standard deviations above its three-year average of eight times given the correlation between the stock and crude oil prices. 
Online media reported that an explosion and fire occurred at Petroliam Nasional Bhd’s (Petronas) Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project in Pengerang last Friday. The blast, which appeared to stem from a leaking gas tank, was loud enough to be heard within a 50km radius of the project. So far, two persons have been reported to be injured in the incident.Recall that the group’s 50%-owned Pengerang petrochemical division has reached mechanical completion of 96% with production expected to commence towards the later parts of the second half of FY19. Back in 2017, PetChem sold a 50% stake in PRPC Polymers to Saudi Aramco for RM3.8 billion.Given Petronas’ strict adherence to health, safety and environment requirements, we expect an extensive investigation into the causes of this incident, which could delay the commencement of petrochemical production.Management expects minimal contributions this year, with plant utilisation around 70% for the first three to six months which will progressively be ramped up to 90% over a time frame yet to be confirmed due to the complexity and integration required of Petronas’ refinery.Likewise, our FY19 forecasts have not incorporated any increase in PetChem’s output given that the group has guided that average plant utilisation could remain flattish above 90%, similar to FY16 to FY18. This is supported by five major turnaround activities this year, which will be spread out over the first quarter of FY19 (1QFY19) to 3QFY19, compared with six in FY18.However, if the Rapid investigation defers production next year, we expect a six-month delay to cause PetChem’s FY20F earnings to slightly decline by 3%, assuming that product prices are stable. For now, we maintain our forecasts pending further clarity from management.Even though management’s market guidance for 1QFY19 is bearish, we remain sanguine given the strong correlation between the group’s product prices and Brent crude oil prices which have risen by 37% since Dec 31, 2018 to US$71 (RM291.81) a barrel currently.This will be a greater impact on the group than temporary delays in Rapid commencement as a 1% increase in average product prices will translate into a higher 3% rise in net profit.PetChem currently trades at a reasonable FY19F EV/Ebitda of nine times, which translates into a 26% discount (versus its three-year average discount of 17%) to Taiwan-based Formosa Petrochemical’s premium 12 times, while its dividend yield is fair at 4%. — AmInvestment Bank, April 12",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/petchem-1q-outlook-promising-higher-brent-crude-oil-prices,"2019-05-01 20:03:24"

A BusinessWorld article stated that the company is negotiating with banks for the possible acquisition of Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Philippines' assets.The index snapped two weekly losses to end higher for the week. Vietnam shares closed 0.3% weaker, with financial and real estate stocks dragging the index lower. For the week, the index dropped 0.6%. Meanwhile, Malaysian stocks snapped their three-day losing streak to end 0.4% firmer, while the index slipped 0.7% for the week, marking its fourth consecutive weekly loss. Also buoying sentiment was the agreement between Malaysia and China to resume construction of a multi-billion dollar rail project, after months of negotiations that strained ties between the two trade partners.However, gains in the Malaysian index were capped by chemicals producer Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, which ended 1.3% weaker.  A fire was brought under control early on Friday, after an explosion at a Malaysian oil refinery being developed by state oil firm Petronas, which was testing its facilities ahead of planned commercial operations later this year.

Maintain hold with an upgraded target price (TP) of 77 sen from 61 sen: Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MMHE) announced that its joint venture (JV) with Hiap Seng Engineering Ltd (HSEL) had been awarded a master service agreement for integrated turnaround main mechanical and maintenance mechanical static from Petronas. The agreement is valid for five years with the option to extend by Petronas. HSEL is a Singapore-listed company specialising in plant design, fabrication, construction and maintenance in the oil and gas, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. 
We are positive on the announcement as it showcases MMHE’s ability to win more contracts in the onshore plant maintenance space. We understand that there are many other companies being awarded under the master service agreement and each contractor is assigned to a particular zone. However, no contract value was disclosed as it is on a call-out basis, dependent on the client’s requirements.HSEL specialises in plant maintenance and has business presence in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates and so on. The split of equity stakes between MMHE and HSEL was not disclosed. We gather that MMHE is responsible for the normal maintenance work while HSEL will perform the plant turnaround. Such a JV will enable MMHE to leverage on HSEL’s technical expertise while HSEL can grow its Malaysian market which only contributed about 3% of its total revenue for financial year 2018 (FY18). Should the JV be able to establish a track record, we do not discount the possibility of MMHE winning more of such contracts locally.We have made no change to our earnings estimates as we reckon that the earnings contribution from this contract would not be too material.Despite maintaining our earnings estimates, we have increased our TP to 77 sen (from 61 sen), pegged at a higher multiple of 0.5 times FY19 price-to-book value (from 0.4 times), premised on its ability to expand its plant maintenance business which is generally recurring in nature, coupled with improving prospects following the stabilisation of oil prices above US$65 (RM267.15) a barrel level. This provides further certainty for Petronas to roll out more jobs in the near term based on earmarked local upstream capital expenditure spending of RM15 billion this year. All in, we maintain our “hold” rating as the abovementioned catalysts could be offset by an unexciting financial performance for the next two quarters amid a strong balance sheet (a net cash position of 37 sen a share). — Hong Leong Investment Bank Research, April 11",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mmhes-petronas-job-win-improves-prospects-more-contracts,"2019-05-01 20:03:34"

In short, this means more business for MHB.Previously, shipowners had delayed to dry-dock their ships for the installation of the engine cleaning systems to meet the new IMO 2020 requirement as the implementation date was not known yet. IMO 2020 seeks to reduce ships’ sulphur emission to 0.5% from 3.5% of current bunker fuel.Overall, the total utilisation of the marine unit is more than 75%, he told the media after MAB’s annual general meeting yesterday.Year-to-date, the group has bid for RM5.9 billion worth of jobs, of which 60% of the works are overseas and the rest local.The group’s order book stood at RM760 million as at end-2018.Having been through the challenging and volatile market in recent years, MHB intends to cultivate recurring income stream to diversify its earnings.Nasarudin said the group does not want to be dependent on only one business segment.He expects the current financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 (FY19) to be a “better year” than the previous one on the back of its marine segment.“We are now looking at turning around services on onshore plants, long-term agreement for fabrication of offshore facilities, and also looking into maintenance services for offshore,” he added.Nasarudin noted that these jobs, despite not having “large value”, will provide a steady source of income to help defray the group’s overhead costs.One notable recurring job is a five-year service contract from its parent company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas). The value of the contract, which comes with an option for extension, is not specified as it is on a call-off contract basis.The contract is awarded to a joint venture between MHB’s wholly-owned unit Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Sdn Bhd and Hiap Seng Engineering Ltd.

Its marine segment saw an operating loss of RM81.7 million versus an operating profit of RM52.8 million in FY17.Its heavy engineering segment registered a higher operating loss of RM39 million, from RM36.7 million loss in the prior year, due to the closeout of completed projects in the previous year.Also, the company has set aside about RM150 million to RM200 million on capital expenditure (capex) this year to build its new Dry Dock 3 facility.As at the end of February this year, the construction of the Dry Dock 3 is about 60% completed, said Nasarudin, adding that this dry dock is on track to be completed by May 2020.The capex allocated this year includes part of the RM520 million allocated to build this new dry dock facility, some RM150 million of which were used last year.The capex will be funded largely by bank borrowings.At 2.38pm, the counter was up 1.5 sen or 1.88% to 81.5 sen, valuing it at RM1.3 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mhb-looks-more-steady-recurring-income,"2019-05-01 20:03:36"

But he had never been to Malaysia before he was hired to head Maxis Bhd, billionaire Ananda Krishnan’s leading mobile operator. Ogut will officially take the CEO’s chair on May 1. Insiders, however, knew that the former Vodafone Turkey CEO was to fill the position when he was named Maxis’ chief operating officer last September.Robert Nason — who was already a director on Maxis’ board since March 2016 when he was named interim CEO last April, following the departure of former CEO Morten Lundal — will remain on the board after his contract ends on April 30. That Nason was chairman of Australian pay-TV company Foxtel Pty Ltd from 2012 to 2017 has renewed speculation of Ananda mulling a merger between Maxis and Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, the pay-TV provider he controls.Changes at the helm at both companies have also not gone unnoticed by those reading the tea leaves. The enigmatic billionaire, who sold the idea of building the 88-storey Petronas Twin Towers to Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad in the early 1990s, continues to keep his cards close to his chest.That Ananda-controlled Tanjong Plc — which owns 67% of the 49-storey Menara Maxis that sits adjacent to the iconic twin towers — last December sold its Tropical Islands Resort in Krausnick, Germany, for €226 million (RM1.04 billion) has also sparked speculation of corporate exercises and cash injections being mulled at his oil and gas concern, Bumi Armada Bhd, which last year lost 80% of its market value and analysts reckon may need a cash call. Astro also saw its market capitalisation halve last year while Maxis only eased 11% — the least among large locally listed telecommunications companies.If Ogut is perturbed by the speculation, he does not show it.“I am excited to be part of this fantastic organisation and it is certainly a proud moment for me to be chosen to lead a company that is moving into its next phase of growth. There are so many opportunities ahead of us and I am really looking forward to the future of Maxis. At Vodafone, I was a member of the team that transformed the biggest mobile company in Europe into the biggest converged operator there. I feel this valuable experience is important and I am glad to be given this opportunity to share my experience with the team in taking Maxis to the next level of growth,” Ogut tells The Edge.He and the Maxis management have set themselves a RM10 billion target as it embarks on a five-year plan to transform Maxis from a consumer and mobile-centric player into the country’s leading converged communications and digital services company.“Since September, we have been working on a long-term plan … to make sure Maxis embarks on this journey for growth. It starts with changing the company from a mobile operator to a converged solutions company. This will get us at least RM10 billion [service revenue] by 2023 ... we see many opportunities. The opportunities lie in the strategy actually, and we call it the MaxPlan.“The number one opportunity that we see is, Maxis should be for everybody in Malaysia, for every home, company and everything. It is not just about individuals but also about companies, homes, government and things,” Ogut says, relating the possibilities surrounding artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) that are expected to be pervasive as the world adopts 5G technology.“We will continue to be the leader in mobile connectivity, both in prepaid and postpaid. We want to be the leading convergence player. We are telling people for all your connectivity needs, your home, yourself or your family, we want to be servicing all of it.”Maxis chose to grab the first mover advantage when it got access to fibre at affordable wholesale prices with the Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP). According to Ogut, Maxis launched FibreNation packages for homes and businesses last September, followed closely by its MaxisOne Prime plan for families to have fibre at home. Maxis is also moving to expand in Sabah and Sarawak, having secured access to Sacofa Sdn Bhd’s fibre assets.As at end-2018, Maxis had attained 249,000 fibre connections. It added 64,000 connections last year, 30,000 in 4Q2018 alone. It also converted 75% of its existing base to new, faster broadband plans as it was able to entice upgrades, thanks to the MSAP.In short, Maxis wants to help its customers not only have fun with unlimited data but also succeed and prosper by harnessing the benefits of technology. That, it reckons, will advance Malaysia’s digital future.Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo, who is for ubiquitous connectivity at affordable prices, has said the success of the upcoming 5G test bed in Cyberjaya and Putrajaya could be a huge leap forward for Malaysia. The country is taking a practical approach to adoption, with focus on improving yield for industry and enhancing people’s quality of life.Malaysia needs to pay attention to not fall behind. Some 60% of the world’s economy will be digitised by 2022, with growth in every industry driven by digitally enhanced offerings, operations and relationships, was among top predictions by market intelligence provider International Data Corporation (IDC) this year. IDC also expects worldwide spend on IoT to increase by more than 15% to US$745 billion this year and breach the US$1 trillion mark by 2022.Maxis’ ambition ties in with the need for businesses to future-proof their revenue streams as multiple industries seek to reinvent themselves to remain relevant in a digitised economy.“We will double our enterprise business  in three years and triple it in five years,” says Ogut, relating how Maxis is working with various partners to deliver what customers need.Apart from its usual annual RM1 billion capital expenditure (capex) to enhance network quality, Maxis is setting aside another RM1 billion “growth capex” over the next three years to cater for demand from new growth. It will explore with customers all areas that can help them reduce cost, increase sales, have better stakeholder engagement and improve efficiency.“We want to be the one-stop provider for enterprise solutions, starting with connectivity, security, e-commerce, managed services, cloud. We offer all these solutions to our customers on top of the connectivity ... we offer them all these different solutions. Internet of Things is a great way for companies to start digitalising their businesses. We want Maxis for all enterprises — small, medium, big, government institutions, NGOs,” he says, noting that Maxis is ready to partner the government and be an enabler in Malaysia’s digital transformation.Agriculture is among the areas Maxis is looking at to make a real difference for Malaysia, he says. Incidentally, when asked about 5G, Gobind has said boosting plantation yield is a “very important” focus for the country. He has also said the agriculture sector, fisheries, medicine and smart cities were among 5G verticals that the government was giving specific focus to. Leveraging premium baseMaxis does not currently provide a breakdown of how many of its customers are from the enterprise market, but Ogut helpfully points out that “enterprise is mostly postpaid”.With an average revenue per user (ARPU) of RM94 a month from its 3.2 million postpaid subscribers as at 4Q2018, Maxis’ premium customer base remains the envy of the industry, including its rivals who are attracting customers with lower prices.As at 4Q2018, Celcom had just under three million postpaid subscribers with ARPU of RM92 while Digi had 2.8 million postpaid customers with ARPU of RM77. The Big Three players account for 77.5% of the 11.6 million postpaid customers that Malaysia has, according to data from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). This is down from 96.5% of the market just four years ago.Still, Maxis’ high postpaid ARPU points to customers with higher spending power and businesses that have the capacity to invest if presented with the right value proposition.There is no doubt that customers are also getting harder and more expensive to please. According to Ogut, Maxis is working on delivering more personalised products to its customers. At the same time, it needs to continuously invest in its network to keep its 10 million customers happy, some 85% of whom have smartphones.“Demand for 4G is high. There is massive adoption of 4G along with an increase in 4G device ownership,” Ogut says, noting how data usage is almost doubling every year. Data consumption among Maxis users was 11GB per month on a blended basis, up from 6.7GB in 2017 and 4.1GB in 2016.Growing painsMaxis’ network quality was acknowledged as tops by MCMC’s Network Performance Report 2018, but Ogut says the tremendous growth in data usage among its users is the reason Maxis needs more spectrum. One possibility towards the latter half of this year is the 700MHz spectrum tender, which will only happen when analogue TV is switched off. There is also the potential reallocation for the 2600MHz spectrum that Maxis and its peers will need to prepare for.While Maxis’ RM10 billion service revenue target by 2023 implies an average growth of 4.4% a year over five years from RM8.068 billion in FY2018, its balance sheet will likely first see the impact of costs for its aggressive customer acquisition. That may put pressure on dividends, especially if more money is needed to fund growth and pay for additional spectrum. (See “Will Maxis adjust its dividend policy or raise capital?” on page 55.)As for service revenue, part of the expected decline this year is due to smaller wholesale revenue following the termination of a 3G RAN network sharing agreement with U Mobile, which largely ended last December and will only have a much smaller contribution from January to June this year before ending altogether.Going by the guidance for “low single-digit decline” in service revenue and “mid-single-digit decline” in Ebitda for 2019, the catch-up growth will need to be even stronger from 2020 onwards for Maxis to attain its goal. Assuming a 1% to 3% decline this year, service revenue would have to grow 5.8% to 6.3% a year from 2020 to hit RM10 billion by 2023.Ogut concurs that Maxis’ transformation will not happen overnight, but says the RM10 billion target is attainable if the company can successfully help its enterprise customers move up the value chain.“We can be 40% of a RM2.5 billion mobile connectivity market, which is RM1 billion, or we can extend our leadership and be 10% of a RM25 billion underpenetrated ICT market (which is mobile and fixed connectivity plus managed services, cloud services and IoT). That’s why we are excited. That is where we see the growth from moving to a converged solutions company. If we can double our enterprise market in three years and triple it in five years, we will have a slice of that [bigger] market,” he says. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-connecting-digital-future,"2019-05-01 20:03:37"

(April 9, RM3.80)
Maintain buy with an unchanged target price of RM4.50: Serba Dinamik has rented a third Bintulu service centre (BSC) for one-and-a-half years to cater to higher job flow. 
This will be mainly used to service a five-year onshore maintenance, construction and modification (MCM) contract secured from Petronas Carigali in February 2019 as well as Shell MGS contracts.Serba has received about RM50 million of MCM work orders, expected to be completed by December 2019. It has 849 employees (43% contracted, 41% daily paid, and 16% permanent) in Bintulu to service 21 contracts.The recent expansion into a third BSC is a good sign as Serba’s current capacity is insufficient to cater to the jobs secured.We believe the reallocation to the Bintulu Integrated Energy Hub (BIEH) next year would be a strong rerating catalyst as this would allow Serba to bid for more contracts, especially engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) jobs.Serba’s current outstanding order book of RM8.3 billion comprises RM6 billion of operations and maintenance (O&M) jobs and RM2.3 billion of EPCC jobsThe BIEH targets to achieve physical completion by Dec 10, 2019 with the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) service centre to be completed earlier, by June 2019.BIEH will consist of an MRO facility, steel fabrication yards and warehouse and storage yards, as well as blasting workshops and nine factories.  BSC No 1 and 2, currently on rental, will be progressively moved to the new site.By our estimates, the massive 30-acre (12ha) development will double Serba’s current maintenance floor space, and its fabrication capacity by slightly more than that.We are excited over Serba’s next phase of growth on two fronts: 1) the consolidation would help improve group operating efficiency and lead to better margins, and 2) the increase in capacity would enable Serba to bid for more maintenance and construction jobs in East Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Singapore.Serba is also eyeing nine Petronas liquefied natural gas complex turbine maintenance work, which is still under original equipment manufacturing (OEM).We raised our financial year ending Dec 31, 2020 (FY20) to FY21 earnings by 7% to 10% on the assumption that the operational consolidation would drive improvement in its O&M segment margin (revised from 18% to 18.5%).We also revised upwards our FY20 associate profit assumption to RM18.7 million (CSE Global Ltd: RM12 million, Kota Marudu: RM3 million, Tanzania: RM2 million and remaining from Konsortium Amanie joint venture) and that for FY21 to RM22 million from our earlier less than RM10 forecast.The stock valuation is still compelling at 11 times 2019 price-to-earnings ratio (PER), backed by its strong earnings growth prospects (FY18-20E compound annual growth rate of 22%) driven by its record high order book.We believe the share price in the near term should rerate on good earnings execution and a robust contract flow.Any deferment in clients’ maintenance schedules and poor EPCC execution would result in potential earnings downgrades. — Affin Hwang Capital, April 9",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/serbas-growth-seen-consolidation-larger-capacity,"2019-05-01 20:03:42"

(April 8, 59 sen)
Upgrade to outperform with a higher target price (TP) of 69 sen: Having suffered a lacklustre financial year 2019 (FY19), we see a potential restoration of earnings visibility in FY20, coming from a possible uplift of US shipment suspension by the Department of Commerce (DOC), with a 2H20 boost forming our base-case assumption, and sales from new fields engineering and contingency (E&C) projects, capitalising on Petroliam Nasional Bhd’s (Petronas) increased upstream capital expenditure (capex). 
We increase our FY20E (estimate) earnings by 7%, while keeping our FY19E numbers intact.To recap, in July 2018, Pantech suspended shipments of its carbon steel butt-weld fittings to the US following a preliminary affirmative anti-circumvention determination issued by the DOC.However, we gathered that the DOC has concluded its verifications on Pantech in late-February.Hence,  we feel that an uplift of the shipment suspension may be likely within the coming few months, after the DOC finalises its findings.We believe Pantech may stand as a “dark horse” beneficiary of Petronas’ increased upstream capex. Recall that Petronas had committed to an increased capex of more than RM50 billion for 2019 (from RM47 billion in 2018), of which approximately RM30 billion will be for upstream, after it focused much of previous years’ capex on downstream.The increased upstream capex will be invested on the development of oil and gas new fields. Pantech provides pipes, valves and fittings not only used for the transportation of oil and gas, but also for the E&C phases of the fields.   We believe the potential uplift of US shipment suspension, coupled with orders from local projects may help to mitigate some earnings gap from the completed refinery and petrochemical integrated development projects (estimated to have contributed approximately approximately 30-40% of FY18 earnings, and about 10% of FY19 earnings). Upgrade to “outperform” from “market perform” previously. Similarly, we increase our TP to 69 sen (from 46 sen previously), pegged at 0.9x price to book value (PBV) on FY20E (from “floor-valuation” of 0.6x PBV previously), underpinned by its improved outlook given restoration of earnings’ visibility.   — Kenanga Research, April 8",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/potential-restoration-pantechs-earnings-visibility-fy20-seen,"2019-05-01 20:03:42"

76,"April 08, 2019 14:00 pm +08",PETRONAS,"Lead Story: Value emerges after panic selling over fears of a US recession","LAST week, a torrent of recession- themed news reports, coupled with the US’ inverted yield curve — a huge development according to Bloomberg — prompted a swift retreat from the markets. The FBM KLCI was not spared, crumbling to its worst week of the year so far.But on the bright side, analysts say that the heavy selldown has resulted in value emerging.“It is true that the inverted yield curve has triggered some concern over a potential recession in the US, but we do not think that alone is conclusive in predicting a recession. We think that the market selldown amid the uncertainty could create buying opportunities for some traders as well as long-term investors as share prices [have] come down to attractive values,” says Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau.Even before the US Treasury yield curve inverted, Maybank IB Research head of research Wong Chew Hann was advocating Malaysian equities following a sharp decline in the market in March. The potential was highlighted at the recent Invest Malaysia 2019 Capital Market Forum. “With the FBM KLCI having fallen so much, there is definitely value for investors,” she tells The Edge, noting that some foreign funds look at the stock market from a top-down approach while others prefer a bottom-up approach.“For those who wanted to exit Malaysia, I think they would already have done so by the end of last year. In February, there was selling but it was likely due to profit-taking after January’s net buy into the equity market.“What has happened recently [in March] is likely to do with the rebalancing of the MSCI Index, where China has a higher allocation. We see that foreign funds are also selling in Thailand,” Wong observes.Affin Hwang Asset Management portfolio manager Lim Chia Wei believes it is too early to conclude that a US recession is imminent. “The US yield curve inversion (10-year against 3-month) is a useful indicator to measure recessionary risk. However, there are cases when yield curve inversion is temporary and does not lead to a recession. It is important to monitor if the curve inverts further or reverts to a positive curve in the coming months.“Apart from the yield curve, the US Leading Economic Index (LEI) is also a good indicator of recessionary risk. The US LEI is healthy and is not indicating an imminent recession. It is best to look at various indicators as a whole instead of looking at each indicator in isolation. At the moment, it is not conclusive that a US recession is imminent in the next 12 months.”He also points to the pickup in China’s credit impulse amid signs of economic stabilisation and green shoots of recovery. “Optimistically, if China’s stimulus takes form and if there is a resolution to the trade dispute, global trade could then pick up and lead to improved growth.“We believe that the majority of stock market participants are reading the yield curve as an indication of higher recessionary risk, but that is not conclusive by itself. After the knee-jerk decline on March 22, stock markets have recovered in the following days.”He says Affin Hwang AM will continue to monitor recessionary risks closely and reposition as the global environment shifts. “Global growth has slowed down and in such an environment, sectors with structural-growth stories that can deliver above-average returns tend to do well despite higher valuations. These include the internet and software sectors, which we like.”CIMB Investment Bank Bhd head of Malaysia research and regional head of agribusiness research, Ivy Ng, also shrugged off talk of a US recession. “We are not expecting a recession in the US. While US gross domestic product growth is slowing in line with expectations as fiscal stimulus fades, steady demand in the private sector, positive labour market developments and, more recently, a more dovish and patient US Federal Reserve are likely to provide support for continued economic expansion,” she says.She adds that the bank’s preferred sectors include glove manufacturers, oil and gas (O&G) and healthcare, as well as companies that have defensive earnings and good dividend yields.“In our strategy report, we provided six investment themes for 2019, which are M&A (mergers and acquisitions), the US-China trade war, GLC (government-linked companies) reform, companies that offer defensive earnings, companies that offer high dividend yields and stocks that may have been oversold,” Ng says, adding that the bank is “underweight” on construction and building materials at the moment.The small cap space is also attractive in terms of valuations owing to the small-cap index’s underperformance against the FBM KLCI last year — the potential exploited by savvy investors who jumped in late last year or earlier this year to boost the small-cap index.What is holding investors back?Maybank IB Research’s Wong believes investors may be cautious due to subdued earnings growth as well as policy risks.“As for those who look to take positions in the bigger cap stocks or those within the FBM KLCI, I think there are two main issues. First is the subdued corporate earnings growth. In fact, for our research universe, market earnings for last year were actually on a decline. Growth was negative.“It [earnings growth for the market] was flattish in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and we saw a bit of a rebound in 2017 at about 6% to 7% but it fell back into negative territory last year.”Foreign investors also want policy stability, which to them is still lacking even though the Pakatan Harapan government has been in power for nearly a year.“We saw what happened last year to the telco sector, construction and even casino operators. I think there are a few more policy decisions pending that the government will need to sort out this year, and that people are watching closely to see how they unfold,” Wong says.Maybank IB Research is “overweight” on the O&G sector.Wong says year to date, the crude oil price has rebounded and the bank expects it to stay at an average of US$65 per barrel for the year.

Resetting foreign exchange rates with overseas dealers could also enlarge margins.While construction stocks may have seen some recovery, Wong cautions investors to be careful of slimmer margins even if mega-infrastructure projects, such as the East Coast Rail Link ultimately get the go-ahead.“If the value [of the project] is lower, I think the margins will come off as well. If you actually win a job with very thin margins, your margin for error is very small. If anything goes wrong, it can be negative for the companies.

If they (CEP) are wrong, then we will have to face court action against us. We have to be very careful about exposing this,” the prime minister told reporters in parliament.“Because this is actually a private set-up to advise me and the government on what can and cannot be done, but in the process, they may mention names and all that, which may expose the government to legal action,” he added.To recap, the CEP was established after the historic change in government in May last year. The members included former two-time finance minister Tun Daim Zainuddin, ex-central banker Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz, former Petronas CEO and president Tan Sri Hassan Marican and economist Jomo Kwame Sundram.The CEP was dissolved after its 100-day mandate expired. Before its dissolution, the council had prepared a comprehensive report for the government that contained its key findings and recommendations.To be fair, Mahathir may be right in saying that some of the information in the report could be sensitive. Some former CEP members have acknowledged this. However, several of them have since said publicly that the report also contains a wealth of insights, including what needs to be done to reform the nation.Given Pakatan Harapan’s commitment to a transparent administration, surely there is a middle path whereby the report could be released by omitting the sensitive parts?",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/frankly-speaking-choosing-middle-path,"2019-05-01 20:03:46"

The company expects to continue drilling in mid-2020, said Seitchik. When asked about the time line for first oil, Seitchik said: “eight to 10 years would be extremely long for us.”International oil companies piled into Mexico’s vast oil terrain over the past several years following 2014 energy reforms that opened the sector to private investment for the first time in almost eight decades. The new government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has lambasted the reforms, calling on companies that won blocks in the bid rounds to invest and produce oil quicker. His government has suspended new oil auctions until companies show results, he has said.The political shift has put pressure on companies that are already operating in Mexico’s shallow and deep-waters, and has increased demand for ‘farm-ins,’ or buying stakes in oil assets from private companies in Mexico.“We are not only looking at the low-hanging fruit,” said Puteri Nurlina, exploration chief for Petronas Mexico, which operates in Mexico under the name PC Carigali, speaking at a panel during the same event. The Malaysian state-owned firm has stakes in 10 shallow and deep-water blocks in Mexico, where it is the operator for half of them. In February, Mexico’s National Hydrocarbons Commission approved its purchase of a 30% stake in China National Offshore Oil Corporation’s block in the oil-rich deep-water Perdido Fold Belt for an undisclosed amount.Repsol, which has six offshore blocks in Mexico, is also seeking to drill two new wells next year, said Sergio Limardo, Repsol’s country manager in Mexico. “There’s an abundance of data in Mexico that existed by the time we all came, so that has allowed us to evaluate the blocks a little faster and move faster,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/oil-explorers-push-ahead-mexico-amlo-asks-more-output,"2019-05-01 20:03:59"

He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.Goldman Sachs is facing charges in Kuala Lumpur over its role in helping raise US$6.5 billion for 1MDB. Goldman denies wrongdoing and says officials under Najib's administration lied to mislead its staff.'When the time comes'Mahathir, who was previously prime minister for 22 years from 1981 to 2003, said Goldman could only do business in Malaysia ""if they pay us what we are asking for"", reiterating a figure of US$7.5 billion given by the finance ministry.""Because they were not prudent ... they are supposed to study the borrowers and lenders properly,"" he said, adding that he was willing to negotiate with the bank.Mahathir said his government was also in talks with the U.S. Department of Justice over Goldman Sachs.Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In an effort to reduce Malaysia's debt after the 1MDB scandal, Mahathir is considering the listing or sale of stakes in state-owned enterprises, including Malaysia Airlines.There has been speculation this could include selling a portion of Petronas, Malaysia's national energy behemoth and the world's third-biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas.But Mahathir said this was not on the cards.""It has always even given the government good returns. We have no plans to privatise or to sell Petronas,"" he said.There is daily speculation in Malaysia about when Mahathir, who is well into his nineties, will hand over power to one-time foe and former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.Mahathir, whose five-year term would end in 2023, had originally promised to cede control to Anwar in 2020.""I will step down when the time comes ... but we have not fixed a date,"" he said.""I promised I will not go up to five years.

102,"March 27, 2019 15:00 pm +08",PETRONAS,"RM13 bil petrochemical project in Lahad Datu raises eyebrows ","A RM13 billion investment by Burel Industries Sdn Bhd to build a petrochemical plant — together with a state-owned entity — in Lahad Datu, Sabah, has raised several questions, mainly due to its location.Lahad Datu, which is located in southeast Sabah, is out of the way of the major east-west trade route, which traverses the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca. Many petrochemical plants and refineries have been built close to these major waterways due to their strategic location.Investors in petrochemical plants must factor in logistics costs, especially if the raw material is sourced far away from the plant, says a shipping official.“The location does not make sense to me. Lahad Datu is not an ideal location for a petrochemical plant. The logistics cost would be a fundamental equation in making that decision,” says the shipping official, who declined to be named.“If they are producing polymers, the largest markets are the big developing markets such as China, India, Latin America and the Middle East. Therefore, the plant should be built [close to] the major trading route between east and west.”To recap, on March 7, POIC Sabah Sdn Bhd, the owner and operator of the Palm Oil Industrial Cluster in Lahad Datu, signed a term sheet agreement with Burel Industries Sdn Bhd for the development of a petrochemical plant in POIC Lahad Datu.The investment, if it materialises, will be the single largest investment in Sabah to date. It is envisaged that the plant will produce about two million tonnes of petrochemical products a year, according to media reports on the signing ceremony.Burel Industries was represented by chairman Per Brandtzag while POIC Sabah was represented by CEO Datuk Dr Pang Teck Wai. Also present was  Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Shafie Apdal.Prior to the project being announced, the single largest investment in Sabah was the RM4.5 billion Sabah Ammonia and Urea (Samur) plant by Petroliam Nasional Bhd in Sipitang Oil and Gas Industrial Park. Samur produces 1.2 million tonnes per year of granulated urea and 740,000 tonnes of liquid ammonia per year, according to Petronas.The Sipitang Oil and Gas Industrial Park is located on the west coast of Sabah, near Labuan and Brunei.According to Guna Mahalingam, a director of Burel Industries, Lahad Datu was selected because of the natural deep draft of its port, which has a depth of 20m to 23m. The port is also off the two seas that connect Australia and New Zealand with the rest of Asia.“The incentives provided by the state government and the terms of lease are also very attractive, making the location the best among those that we have considered,” says Guna. He says Burel Industries looked at Lumut in Perak, Gebeng in Pahang and Johor Baru as possible locations.Lahad Datu is closer to the Celebes and Sulu seas than the South China Sea, through which about 30% of global maritime crude oil trade passes.The Lahad Datu port is about 730km from Sapangar Bay oil and container terminal in Kota Kinabalu, slightly more than a 1½-day journey. Bintulu Port, the busiest port for oil and gas in Malaysia, is about 1,300km away. The Port of Singapore, which is the hub for petrochemicals and oil trading in Asia, is about 2,500km away, or a six-day journey, without factoring in waiting times and heavy traffic in the Singapore Strait.Questions sent to POIC Sabah and the Malaysian Investment Development Authority were not answered.Representatives of both parties advised The Edge that it would be best to talk to Burel Industries about the project.According to media reports, Burel Industries has secured raw material for the petrochemical plant from Saudi Arabia. It is not known who the Saudi Arabian supplier is nor the transport arrangements for the raw material.Petrochemical plants are usually built close to major trade routes or a trading hub. For example, Petronas’ Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development was built in Pengerang due to its strategic location along the east-west trade route and proximity to Singapore. The national oil company’s older refineries and petrochemical plants in Kerteh and Bintulu were built there due to their proximity to the raw material source, being the oil and gas produced in the offshore fields of Terengganu and Sarawak respectively.Lahad Datu is neither close to the major east-west trade route along the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea, nor to an oil trading hub such as Singapore. Furthermore, the raw material will not be sourced from Sabah’s offshore fields. Who is behind Burel?According to the Companies Commission of Malaysia, Burel is owned by a Singaporean company named Ingrit Holdings Pte Ltd.However, according to Guna, a Saudi Arabian company called Rawda Group has signed a shareholder agreement to undertake a 30% interest in the petrochemical project.Meanwhile, a Switzerland-based financial advisory and consultancy firm, Strategic Swiss Partners (SSP), is acting as the exclusive financial adviser for the project, says Guna, who is the CEO and founder of SSP.According to SSP’s website, the company has several prominent Malaysians on its list of advisers. Among them are former law minister Datuk Zaid Ibrahim, founder of the Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute Tan Sri Michael Yeoh and Tan Sri Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak, group chairman of ACE Investment Banking Group.According to its website, SSP has provided services for projects in various industries, including energy, banking and finance, Islamic banking and finance, real estate, infrastructure, hospitality, healthcare and artificial intelligence and robotics.Apart from Rawda Group, Guna says  China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation, or CMC, has also taken a stake in the project, and will be the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning partner.The Rawda Group is not unknown in Malaysia. In September 2017, Tabung Haji extended the lease for two hotels owned by Al-Rawda Investment for Real Estate Development and Project Management Ltd in Makkah and Madinah for the use of Malaysian pilgrims for another 20 years. However, it is not clear whether the Rawda Group mentioned by Guna is the same Al-Rawda that leased the two hotels in Saudi Arabia to Tabung Haji. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/rm13-bil-petrochemical-project-lahad-datu-raises-eyebrows,"2019-05-01 20:04:03"
103,"March 26, 2019 16:00 pm +08",PETRONAS,"BIMB still expected to beat its peers","IN recent years, BIMB Holdings Bhd has consistently outperformed the banking industry on important fronts like return on equity (ROE) and financing growth. But with the operating environment getting increasingly tough, a key question on investors’ minds is, will it be able to sustain the strong growth levels?CEO Mohd Muazzam Mohamed acknowledges that it will be challenging but he is confident the group will keep growing over the next three years, albeit at a more moderate pace.“We used to do double-digit growth in net financing in the past years but since 2017, we slowed to single-digit growth. Last year, we did 8.5% [versus the industry’s 4.5%]. This year, it will moderate further, probably to around 7%, but it would still be above the industry average, I would say. Growth in profit before zakat and tax (PBZT) may be a bit slower too, but there will still be growth,” he tells The Edge in an interview.A financial holding company, BIMB derives about 80% of its earnings from its wholly-owned Islamic lender Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd and the rest from its 59.6%-owned Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd.Two weeks ago, BIMB turned in a record net profit of RM682 million for FY2018, a 10.1% increase year on year, helped by solid financing growth, cost containment and stable margins.Its earnings fell within analysts’ expectations and translated into an ROE of 14.3%, higher than the industry average of around 10%. PBZT grew 12.5% to RM1.07 billion while revenue grew 12.9% to RM4.2 billion.BIMB’s earnings were commendable considering that the group had made an allowance for impairment of financial assets of RM81.4 million — owing mainly to the kicking in of the new MFRS 9 accounting standard — compared with a write-back of RM15.4 million in the previous year. Three-year planAccording to Muazzam, BIMB’s growth over the next three years will be fuelled mainly by consumer financing. However, an increased focus on fee-based income and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) will give the group a boost, he says.BIMB plans to grow fee-based income by driving its bancatakaful and wealth management businesses further. This will be done by increasing product offerings as well as improving staff productivity, he says.“As for wealth management, we’re doing two things. We’re doubling our sales executives to about 200 this year. We’re not hiring new people but converting over 100 of our existing 520 personal financial executives — the people who sell cards, personal and house financing — into wealth executives. Of course, they’ll need to take the necessary exams, obtain licences and all that first. The other thing we’re doing is increasing our products,” he shares.Its fund management firm BIMB Investment Management Bhd has a partnership with UK-based Arabesque Asset Management that it hopes to tap further. Arabesque is an environmental, social and governance (ESG)-Quant specialist that uses robo technology and data analytics when investing.Muazzam says BIMB is open to the possibility of selling up to 40% equity interest in BIMB Investment to Arabesque as it sees value in what its foreign partner brings to the table. It is understood that Arabesque has an option to take an equity stake in BIMB Investment but has yet to exercise it.BIMB’s fee-based income as a percentage of gross revenue stood at below-9% last year on the consumer side, and the target is to increase it to 10% this year and 12% by end-2021.As for SMEs, Muazzam says BIMB’s financing to this segment stood at RM2.2 billion as at-end 2018. He wants to grow this by about 10% this year. “We have so far been focused on the bigger SMEs and not so much on the smaller entrepreneurs. Going foward, we will continue to focus on our vendor programmes with big companies like Petronas, Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia, where we finance [SMEs] that have contracts with them. But, at the same time, we are developing capabilities [that will help us finance] SMEs in the lower-revenue ranks,” he says.For example, he says BIMB is working with a group of professors to come up with a psychometric model.“In the past, a bank’s credit evaluation model was about assessing the customers’ ability to pay. Even though we say we have a behavioural card, what we look at is past payment behaviours. But now, we want to develop a tool for us to be able to assess the customer’s willingness to pay ... because as we go down the [SME] tier, these customers would have less of or little historical credit track record. That’s why banks find it difficult to give them financing. But, as you know, there’ll be a lot more of such companies in the future, so we must develop new tools to assess them,” he says.This is, however, still at the developmental phase. “Hopefully, by 2021, we will be able to launch it so we can go into [financing] online retailers and all that,” he says. CODE21Home and personal financing will remain BIMB’s main growth drivers. Last year, these accounted for 53.4% and 39.4% respectively of its consumer financing portfolio.Muazzam is not overly concerned about the weaker property market affecting the group’s asset quality. “The good thing is that we focus on properties that are priced at RM750,000 and below. Supply and demand is still there, so we are comfortable about building in that segment. On the corporate side, our exposure to real estate is not that big and we are very selective ... the [vulnerable] areas like hotels and big retail malls, we try not to get involved,” he explains.Its exposure to real estate stands at just 3.68% of total financing, while for construction, it is 5.2%.Meanwhile, BIMB’s exposure to the oil and gas sector — an area that analysts continue to monitor closely given weak oil prices — has come down to 8.4% as at end-2018 from 9% a year earlier.“To be honest, for us, there is no specific sector that has been showing a worrying trend,” Muazzam remarks. He points out that BIMB’s asset quality remains strong, with gross impaired financing ratio at just 0.92% as at end-2018, better than the industry’s 1.45%.Muazzam shares that Bank Islam has embarked on a three-year transformation programme, CODE21, so named because it aspires towards culture, operational and digital excellence by end-2021. It involves the improvement of its processes and controls and retraining of staff.The programme is ultimately aimed at making BIMB the country’s leading digital Islamic bank of choice by 2021. BIMB aspires to achieve PBZT of RM1 billion by end-2021, from RM810.3 million last year, says Muazzam.Additionally, it wants to be the leading bank for social finance. Initiatives on this end will be through Sadaqa House, Bank Islam’s donation platform that enables funds to be channelled to needy communities through the bank’s partners.Over the 2019-2021 period, Bank Islam is expected to spend RM300 million on digital initiatives and technology, starting with RM150 million this year.Nevertheless, Muazzam expects BIMB’s cost-to-income ratio (CIR) to lower further to 51% this year from 57.5% last year and 61.4% in 2017.The group’s CIR had been on the high side over the years as it added branches in a bid to reach an optimal level. It currently has 148 branches and has no plans to add more.Muazzam is fairly confident the bank will be able to maintain its net income margin (NIM) at around 2.65% this year as there is less pressure to chase costly deposits. Last year, it scrambled to increase long-term deposits in a bid to raise its net stable funding ratio to over 100%. It raised its base rate by 13 basis points last November.As for Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga, the public-listed company has had good growth in recent years, with PBZT growing at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14.4% over the last five years compared with 3.7% for Bank Islam. “Its PBZT will continue to grow this year, albeit probably not as strongly as last year’s 32.7%,” says Muazzam. Restructuring soonBIMB’s three-year plan does not involve a merger with another bank, says Muazzam. “We don’t rule it out, but at this point in time, there isn’t any proposal on the table. I would say, if we’ve got to merge, it must be with a [partner] that will further strengthen us and not cause the bank to carry extra weight going forward,” he remarks.In the meantime, though, all eyes are on BIMB’s anticipated restructuring exercise, which will involve Bank Islam taking over its listed status. The move is aimed at collapsing BIMB’s financial holding structure.According to Muazzam, there is likely to be an announcement on this in the second quarter. He declines to divulge more details, saying only that the group first has to address a shareholder debt. The Edge reported in late January that BIMB, controlled by Lembaga Tabung Haji, was seriously considering undertaking a private placement of new shares to raise funds to repay a shareholder debt of some RM800 million ahead of the restructuring.“More visibility on BIMB’s much-talked-about restructuring plans could fuel investor interest in the stock, though we think consistent delivery of robust earnings growth would also keep the stock on a positive trajectory,” says AllianceDBS Research in a March 4 report.Bloomberg data shows that eight out of nine analysts who track the stock have a “buy” call on it, with one calling a “hold”. The median target price was RM5.02.According to RHB Research, the stock still has attractive upside, notwithstanding its 19.1% year-to-date increase. “Underlying operations continue to outpace its peers while its balance sheet is healthy. As investors get greater clarity on its reorganisation plans, its price-to-book multiple will rise to levels more reflective of its resilient profitability and position as a proxy to the largest standalone Islamic bank in Malaysia,” it says.   ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bimb-still-expected-beat-its-peers,"2019-05-01 20:04:03"
104,"March 25, 2019 17:00 pm +08",PETRONAS,"Barakah seeks to restructure RM726 mil debt ","THE proposed restructuring scheme of ailing Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd and its main units, PBJV Group Sdn Bhd and Kota Laksamana 101 Ltd, seeks to address as much as RM726.53 million in debt, sources familiar with the matter tell The Edge.While Barakah’s total debt was RM38.66 million, its wholly-owned unit, PBJV, has amassed RM401.01 million in debt, and PBJV’s wholly-owned Kota Laksamana 101 had RM286.86 million in debt.Of the RM726.53 million, RM341.94 million was owed to financial institutions (FIs) and RM384.59 million to unsecured creditors as at June 30, 2018.Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Bhd (EXIM Bank) has the highest exposure among the FIs, amounting to RM295.69 million — RM38.3 million in unsecured loans to Barakah, RM85.12 million unsecured loans to PBJV and a RM172.27 million secured facility extended to Kota Laksamana 101, a company that owns a pipe-laying barge.Other affected FIs include Malayan Banking Bhd, which had given out an RM38.61 million secured facility to PBJV.It is also understood that a chunk of Barakah’s liabilities is off-balance sheet transactions. In early December last year, Barakah changed its financial year end to June 30 from Dec 30.For the first four quarters ended Dec 31, 2018, Barakah suffered a net loss of RM61.58 million from RM243.25 million in revenue. As at end-December, the company had cash and bank balances of RM44. 97 million and fixed deposits with licensed banks amounting to RM85.71 million while on the other side of the balance sheet, it had long-term borrowings of RM172.02 million and short-term debt obligations of RM2.21 million.It is worth noting that the debt obligations of Barakah stated in its restructuring plan are almost four times that stated in its latest balance sheet. The restructuring planThe restructuring plan has two parts. The first addresses PBJV while the second involves Barakah and entails a share premium consolidation, capital reduction, private placement of irredeemable convertible loan stocks (ICULS) and issuance of redeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks (RCULS), among others.PBJV’s secured FI creditors are owed RM45.79 million and its unsecured FI creditors, RM85.58 million, bringing its total debt commitment to RM131.37 million. A chunk of its unsecured debt — RM85.12 million — is owed to EXIM Bank while the balance is with SME Bank.Secured lenders of PBJV include Affin Bank Bhd, Maybank, Public Bank Bhd and CIMB Bank Bhd.It seems that PBJV’s unsecured creditors, which are the FIs, are likely to be compensated by Barakah’s placement of ICULS and issue of RCULS.Unsecured creditors, meanwhile, fall into several categories, with some being settled in the ordinary course of business while others will have to take a 45% haircut.As for Barakah, according to the sources, the main tenets of the restructuring will see the secured FI creditors paid in the ordinary course of business as they are fully secured against fixed deposits pledged under lien.Meanwhile, all secured creditors of PBJV shall be secured up to the amount of their security value as at the cut-off date — June 30, 2018 — and any outstanding amount net of the security will be classified as an unsecured FI creditor and settled pursuant to the proposed debt restructuring scheme of PBJV.The secured creditor of Kota Laksamana 101 — EXIM Bank, which is owed RM172.3 million — will be secured up to RM87.15 million, which is equivalent to the forced sale value of its pipe-laying barge. Other details include the RM87.15 million being paid over a seven-year period, pegged with an interest rate of 5% per annum.The balance RM85.12 million owed is to be ranked as an unsecured FI creditor and settled as per a proposed debt restructuring scheme of PBJV and restructuring of Barakah.Meanwhile, RM17.24 million owed by Kota Laksamana 101 is slated to be waived.Barakah is seeking to place its unsecured creditors (RM384.59 million) in several categories, with some, such as essential creditors, to be settled in full while others could see a waiver of as much as 45% of the debt.Barakah’s restructuring plan requires approval from Bursa Malaysia, the Securities Commission Malaysia, the High Court and all its creditors — secured and unsecured — as well as at the Barakah, PBJV and Kota Laksamana 101 levels and shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting. Barakah’s woesLike other oil and gas players, Barakah had been severely hit by the downturn as crude oil prices fell sharply in 2014 and remained volatile since.Its largest shareholders are CEO Nik Hamdan Daud, with 35.65% equity interest, and Tan Sri Yaw Teck Seng of the Samling group fame, with an 8.97% stake. The Federal Land Development Authority ceased to be a substantial shareholder last June.According to exchange filings, MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd is assisting Barakah in its restructuring.Earlier this month, Barakah announced that a restraining order (RO) against its creditors had been extended for another 90 days, commencing on Jan 14. It was granted the RO on Oct 12 last year.The RO is for Barakah to manage the debt levels of the company and PBJV. It also allows Barakah and its units to negotiate terms with its lenders and creditors without having the threat of any proceedings and actions being brought against the company.In January, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), in a letter — sighted by The Edge — cautioned that PBJV had been suspended by the national oil company since last June due to non-performance. The letter was addressed to several oil and gas players.Petronas also highlighted that there had been complaints about PBJV being financially distressed and not paying its subcontractors. It suggested that a risk assessment and due diligence be undertaken before any jobs are awarded to PBJV.Last August, Barakah bagged a pan-Malaysian maintenance, construction and modification (MCM) contract for a five-year tenure from Sapura Energy Bhd. While the value of the contract was not disclosed, it is understood to exceed RM1 billion.Back then, when Barakah was awarded the contract, Nik Hamdan was reported to have said, “We are pleased to have secured the MCM contract. It is expected to contribute positively to the group’s bottom line and replenish our order book while keeping us occupied for the next five years. Moving forward, we believe 2019 will be an exciting year for us as more oil and gas projects are expected to come onstream following a recovery in the sector.”Barakah closed last Friday at 12.5 sen, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM104.47 million.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/barakah-seeks-restructure-rm726-mil-debt-0,"2019-05-01 20:04:04"

106,"March 25, 2019 09:09 am +08",PETRONAS,"Frontken sees further growth after record years","KUALA LUMPUR: Frontken Corp Bhd may have consistently seen explosive profit growth in the past few years, but its chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Nicholas Ng believes there is still space for growth in all markets where it operates.In an interview with The Edge Financial Daily, Ng said the group is seeing more opportunities in the oil and gas (O&G) sector, especially with more activities in Pengerang, Johor where the Petronas Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (Rapid) project is being developed.“We wish to have a presence there [in Pengerang]. Our services will be needed later as we have received customers’ requests, so we are obviously exploring that as well. Since the second half of last year, we started seeing more activities in the O&G sector, and the momentum seems to be carrying through. If it (the sector) continues with its current momentum, it will be a good year for us,” he added.Brent crude oil price has gained more than 30% this year due to Opec and its partners’ output reductions, as well as supply disruptions in Venezuela and Iran helping to counter a growing American shale production. As of last Friday, Brent was trading at US$67.03 (RM272.14) a barrel. A year ago, the price plunged to a US$50 low; in 2017, it hovered around the US$44 level at one point.Listed on Bursa Malaysia in 2006, Frontken principally provides specialised services such as precision cleaning, refurbishment and coating to the semiconductor industry. This business segment contributed nearly 80% to the group’s top line last year, and the balance by its non-semiconductor business, mainly in providing engineering services to the O&G industry. The group’s key markets are Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.Ng said despite concerns of the overall semiconductor market’s slowdown, the group is still poised for growth this year. He said all indicators so far point towards further growth with rising demand for all things electronics, evident in a continued investments among customers, a growing capital expenditure (capex) in wafer fabrication equipment, and customers guiding for a high single-digit growth.According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, worldwide sales of semiconductors in January 2019 marked a year-on-year sales decline for the first time since July 2016. Sales in January 2019 fell to US$35.5 billion — down 5.7% compared with US$37.6 billion in January 2018, and 7.2% compared with US$38.2 billion in December 2018.“In terms of outlook, based on visibility provided by our customers, we believe there will still be growth this year, but its level may not be as high as before due to a high-base effect.“Just like most companies, it will be difficult trying and maintaining high percentage growths [every year]. But I’d like to think we are far away from the big number; our core earnings suggest a lot more space remains for growth,” Ng said.Since the financial year ended Dec 31, 2015 (FY15), Frontken has been reporting consistently impressive earnings growth, notching record earnings annually. For FY18, Frontken saw a 75% net profit surge to RM52.26 million, from RM29.86 million in FY17. Revenue grew 10.3% to RM327.22 million, from RM296.58 million.The group has been achieving an aggressive bottom-line growth thanks to its continuous investments in research and development (R&D), which Ng said is a crucial cost-saving measure.“Through R&D, we can innovate for more efficient ways of cleaning the same parts, without compromising on quality. Newer technologies from customers’ innovations also mean more complicated equipment and processes requiring our cleaning expertise.”Ng said besides continuous innovation, the group plans to strengthen its foothold in the Chinese market where it sees huge opportunities, although the execution aspect may not be immediate.This probably involves setting up new facilities, instead of servicing China-based clients from its existing Taiwan and Singapore facilities.“When the timing is right, I believe we will have something in China. It is a big market, and it is growing. But we are taking more of a wait-and-see approach, given the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China,” said Ng, also Frontken’s largest shareholder with a 28.4% stake held through direct and indirect interests.Ng added that the group will take some time to identify a strategic location for the new facility to be closer to most major wafer fabrication equipment sprawled across the country — this makes logistics sense since clients send their parts to Frontken daily.For this year, Frontken has earmarked a capex of up to RM10 million. Ng said by 2020, the group should be able to cater to its customers’ wafer fabrication process node of up to five nanometer.On its impressive share price skyrocketing 120% over a year making Frontken a billion ringgit company now, Ng said its management gives little focus on this matter. The stock, settling 1.5 sen higher at 96.5 sen last Friday, had on March 8 hit a record-high closing of 99.2 sen.“What we’re focusing on is trying our best to deliver good earnings, and it is really up to investors out there to think how much our company is worth.“We are now trying to pay dividends consistently. If we are able to continue performing well, and with our healthy cash position, we are looking to return more to shareholders in future.”The net-cash group, which started paying dividends to shareholders in FY17 after a five-year hiatus, said its strong balance sheet positions the group better for acquisition opportunities. Frontken is The Edge Financial Daily’s top pick for the first half of 2019.Maybank IB Research rated Frontken a “buy” stock, with a target price of RM1.04. In its March 15 report, the research firm said it expects Frontken’s strong earnings growth to sustain over three years, backed by work orders for its key customers’ leading-edge technology in Singapore and Taiwan.“We have forecast Frontken to chalk up a robust three-year (FY18 to FY21 estimate) earnings compound annual growth rate of 23%. Our target price of RM1.04 is based on an unchanged 18.8 times FY19 price-earnings ratio, one standard deviation above its five-year forward average of 12.5 times,” Maybank IB Research analyst Mohd Hafiz Hassan wrote.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/frontken-sees-further-growth-after-record-years,"2019-05-01 20:04:05"

""They will have to turn on the tap on capex in the near future,"" he added.""I think we will probably see a lot of investments in one or two years from now.""Although certain O&G companies have emerged on analysts' radar as potential beneficiaries of the O&G industry upcycle, they have largely remained conservative on Wah Seong, citing dwindling orderbook for its O&G segment and margin challenges for its other segments.The group posted its first quarterly net loss in two years in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, due to lower contribution from O&G and renewable energy while its industrial trading and services business sank into losses.Analyst reports underlined that its tenderbook stood at RM5.9 billion at end-2018, with sizeable contract wins expected to occur only in the second half of 2019 — meaning earnings contribution will only come in later.The group has three 'hold' calls and two 'sell' calls, with target prices ranging between 62 sen and RM1, according to Bloomberg.Wah Seong's share price has recovered slightly from its all-time low of 59.5 sen in December last year, with the shares trading at 77 sen apiece at press time.Is Wah Seong trading at a bargain?

There was no immediate response from PTTEP to a Reuters query.Murphy had tapped banks for the potential sale of its majority interests in eight separate offshore production sharing contracts in Malaysia, sources had said.Others familiar with the matter had suggested Spanish oil major Repsol, whose presence in Malaysia is focused on its upstream business, or other global majors could be potential buyers for Murphy's assets.The potential transaction between Murphy and PTTEP comes as M&A activity is heating up in Malaysia's oil and gas sector, where international companies pursuing expansion plans are spotting opportunities.In September, Austrian oil and gas company OMV agreed on a joint venture with Sapura Energy Bhd, paying US$540 million for a 50 percent stake in the exploration assets of the Malaysian firm.In August, citing sources, Reuters reported that US company Hess Corp's Southeast Asian offshore natural gas assets had attracted bid interest from PTTEP and OMV. Hess later said it had no plans to sell its Southeast Asian assets.Malaysian state-owned Petronas partners Murphy in Malaysia.People familiar with Murphy's business had said the company could use the sale proceeds to fund its global expansion plans.In September 2014, Murphy announced the sale of a 30 percent stake in its Malaysian assets to Indonesian state oil company Pertamina for US$2 billion as it cut its overseas holdings.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/murphy-oil-nearing-deal-sell-malaysian-oil-gas-assets-pttep-%E2%80%94-sources,"2019-05-01 20:04:09"

If it is just listings for the sake of listings, the government will not get good valuation as people will not be interested to invest. The government has to see where the demand is in the market and then look at which companies it can list and sell at a good price,” he said.Astramina Advisory Sdn Bhd managing director Wong Muh Rong concurred that Petronas is a likely candidate, given that it is a world-class company with reputable governance, comparing it to Saudi Arabia’s national oil and gas company Saudi Aramco which is also planning an initial public offering in 2021.“The government does not need to let go of a substantial portion of its shareholdings as they can already raise a lot of funds just by monetising a 20% to 30% stake in Petronas.“Petronas is a good candidate. It is not difficult to sell and the government can get fairly good upfront money and use it to boost market activity,” said Wong.On the other hand, another fund manager, who declined to be named, said it is unlikely that an offer for Petronas would be on the table but noted that the government could start divesting its holdings in some of the relatively smaller companies first.“I don’t think the government will list Petronas as it is considered a strategic asset. They can still monetise [it] but maybe just a minority stake or a division under the group,” said the fund manager.He pointed to Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera’s portfolio which includes Affin Bank Bhd and Boustead Holdings Bhd, and said that the government could test the water with the sale of smaller stakes to see how the market reacts before touching the bigger investments.Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie said the investments that could potentially be disposed of depend on the government’s definition of “matured assets”.“Based on Khazanah’s new mandate, it seems to be referring to businesses that can already stand on their own feet, with decent price-to-book that no longer needs institutional funds as anchor investors.“The companies that come to mind in terms of monetisation could be CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, TM and other companies in the utility and aviation sectors,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/listing-unlisted-glcs-will-improve-operations-%E2%80%94-fund-managers,"2019-05-01 20:04:12"

Other affected FIs include Malayan Banking Bhd, which had given out an RM38.61 million secured facility to PBJV.It is also understood that a chunk of Barakah’s liabilities is off-balance sheet transactions. In early December last year, Barakah changed its financial year end to June 30 from Dec 30.For the first four quarters ended Dec 31, 2018, Barakah suffered a net loss of RM61.58 million from RM243.25 million in revenue.As at end-December, the company had cash and bank balances of RM44. 97 million and fixed deposits with licensed banks amounting to RM85.71 million while on the other side of the balance sheet, it had long-term borrowings of RM172.02 million and short-term debt obligations of RM2.21 million.It is worth noting that the debt obligations of Barakah stated in its restructuring plan are almost four times that stated in its latest balance sheet.The restructuring planThe restructuring plan has two parts. The first addresses PBJV while the second involves Barakah and entails a share premium consolidation, capital reduction, private placement of irredeemable convertible loan stocks (ICULS) and issuance of redeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks (RCULS), among others.PBJV’s secured FI creditors are owed RM45.79 million and its unsecured FI creditors, RM85.58 million, bringing its total debt commitment to RM131.37 million. A chunk of its unsecured debt — RM85.12 million — is owed to EXIM Bank while the balance is with SME Bank.Secured lenders of PBJV include Affin Bank Bhd, Maybank, Public Bank Bhd and CIMB Bank Bhd.It seems that PBJV’s unsecured creditors, which are the FIs, are likely to be compensated by Barakah’s placement of ICULS and issue of RCULS.Unsecured creditors, meanwhile, fall into several categories, with some being settled in the ordinary course of business while others will have to take a 45% haircut.As for Barakah, according to the sources, the main tenets of the restructuring will see the secured FI creditors paid in the ordinary course of business as they are fully secured against fixed deposits pledged under lien.Meanwhile, all secured creditors of PBJV shall be secured up to the amount of their security value as at the cut-off date —
June 30, 2018 — and any outstanding amount net of the security will be classified as an unsecured FI creditor and settled pursuant to the proposed debt restructuring scheme of PBJV.The secured creditor of Kota Laksamana 101 — EXIM Bank, which is owed RM172.3 million — will be secured up to RM87.15 million, which is equivalent to the forced sale value of its pipe-laying barge. Other details include the RM87.15 million being paid over a seven-year period, pegged with an interest rate of 5% per annum.The balance RM85.12 million owed is to be ranked as an unsecured FI creditor and settled as per a proposed debt restructuring scheme of PBJV and restructuring of Barakah.Meanwhile, RM17.24 million owed by Kota Laksamana 101 is slated to be waived.Barakah is seeking to place its unsecured creditors (RM384.59 million) in several categories, with some, such as essential creditors, to be settled in full while others could see a waiver of as much as 45% of the debt.Barakah’s restructuring plan requires approval from Bursa Malaysia, the Securities Commission Malaysia, the High Court and all its creditors — secured and unsecured — as well as at the Barakah, PBJV and Kota Laksamana 101 levels and shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting.Barakah’s woesLike other oil and gas players, Barakah had been severely hit by the downturn as crude oil prices fell sharply in 2014 and remained volatile since.Its largest shareholders are CEO Nik Hamdan Daud, with 35.65% equity interest, and Tan Sri Yaw Teck Seng of the Samling group fame, with an 8.97% stake. The Federal Land Development Authority ceased to be a substantial shareholder last June.According to exchange filings, MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd is assisting Barakah in its restructuring.Earlier this month, Barakah announced that a restraining order (RO) against its creditors had been extended for another 90 days, commencing on Jan 14. It was granted the RO on Oct 12 last year.The RO is for Barakah to manage the debt levels of the company and PBJV. It also allows Barakah and its units to negotiate terms with its lenders and creditors without having the threat of any proceedings and actions being brought against the company.In January, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), in a letter — sighted by The Edge — cautioned that PBJV had been suspended by the national oil company since last June due to non-performance. The letter was addressed to several oil and gas players.Petronas also highlighted that there had been complaints about PBJV being financially distressed and not paying its subcontractors. It suggested that a risk assessment and due diligence be undertaken before any jobs are awarded to PBJV.Last August, Barakah bagged a pan-Malaysian maintenance, construction and modification (MCM) contract for a five-year tenure from Sapura Energy Bhd. While the value of the contract was not disclosed, it is understood to exceed RM1 billion.Back then, when Barakah was awarded the contract, Nik Hamdan was reported to have said, “We are pleased to have secured the MCM contract. It is expected to contribute positively to the group’s bottom line and replenish our order book while keeping us occupied for the next five years. Moving forward, we believe 2019 will be an exciting year for us as more oil and gas projects are expected to come onstream following a recovery in the sector.”Barakah closed last Friday at 12.5 sen, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM104.47 million.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/barakah-seeks-restructure-rm726-mil-debt,"2019-05-01 20:04:14"
123,"March 18, 2019 18:17 pm +08",PETRONAS,"What O&G recovery? Subcontractors still not paid on time","AFTER a long and tedious wait, the country’s oil and gas (O&G) services companies are finally beginning to enjoy the benefits of better crude oil prices and increased upstream spending by oil majors.But while some listed companies have started to see a positive turnaround in the latest results season, The Edge has learnt that some smaller vendors have yet to be paid, even though they have completed their subcontracts.“Sorry to say [but] some OGSE (oil and gas services and equipment) companies are having problems getting their payments down the line,” says an executive at an offshore services company.“This does not happen with the NOCs or IOCs (national or international oil companies), but it is more on the part of the main contractors.”Late payments to smaller vendors in the sector have been occurring for decades, information gathered by The Edge reveals.However, it has got worse following the prolonged oil price downturn in 2015, and unfortunately, shows no signs of improvement despite the nascent recovery in the sector.Delayed payments could put a dent in Petroliam Nasional Bhd’s (Petronas) consolidation agenda.According to Petronas president and group chief executive Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, the norm is for Petronas to pay the main contractors as they are its “single point of contact”.That payment is then to be made down the line to the subcontractors. However, when certain main contractors do not keep their end of the bargain, subcontractors may no longer wish to participate, never mind consider mergers and consolidation.The payout may be small relative to the main contractor’s finances, but it is critical for small and medium enterprises. Halting payment amounts to tightening the cash flow — the lifeblood of a company.The national oil and gas company is cognisant of the problem. “We are pretty conscious; we know about the cash flow issue faced by some of our service providers,” Wan Zulkiflee said at Petronas’ FY2018 results briefing last Friday.“On our part, we do take this into account [in] our selection of main contractors [based] on their previous [payout] performance,” he says, adding that Petronas does intervene in some contracts.However, sometimes its hands are tied.“The main contractors are our single point of contact, [and] there are certain terms in the contract that sometimes restrict us from full intervention. So, it is kind of on a contract-by-contract [basis], but we are fully aware of this issue, [and] we have taken initiatives.”Separately, last year, Petronas initiated a matchmaking scheme, called the Vendor Financing Programme, under which seven financial institutions have been roped in to provide vendors easier access to financing.“Essentially, all these efforts are to ease the cash-flow problems faced by subcontractors,” Wan Zulkiflee says.The industry executive confirms that Petronas has intervened in the past and that certain small vendors managed to bypass the main contractors to be paid directly by Petronas and its partners.“We also understand the grievances … for main contractors, the rates are still low. They show profit on paper but cash flow is another issue altogether.“But [the non-payment] is a valid complaint,” the executive says.Malaysia has in excess of 2,700 active O&G companies, most of which are SMEs. Fewer than 50 are listed on Bursa Malaysia.Previously, Petronas had said it would leave industry restructuring and consolidation to market forces as less capable SMEs are expected to drop out and the more capable ones emerge stronger in the long run.This year, Petronas expects to allocate RM15 billion out of “slightly over RM50 billion” in capital expenditure for the domestic upstream segment, up from around RM12 billion last year.But if the issue of non-payment of smaller players persists, O&G SMEs — including the better ones — may end up adrift due to cash-flow concerns, preventing the successful implementation of Petronas’ agenda to build a stronger O&G industry for the future.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/what-og-recovery-subcontractors-still-not-paid-time,"2019-05-01 20:04:14"
124,"March 18, 2019 17:00 pm +08",PETRONAS,"Who’s right about Khazanah’s 2018 (under)performance?","EVIDENTLY, billion-ringgit headline losses were too good an opportunity to gain political mileage to let slip, going by the heated social media exchanges between Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali and former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak last week.When it comes to reported numbers, Najib — who was chairman of Khazanah Nasional Bhd until May 31 last year — is not wrong in saying that the sovereign wealth fund’s RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 were the first it has reported in over a decade.Yet, part of the reason for last year’s underperformance was Khazanah’s portfolio of assets, which was concentrated in a handful of companies it had long invested in. The concentration risk was partly why Khazanah needed to rebalance its portfolio to deliver on its new mandate of growing Malaysia’s long-term wealth.A strategic review of its investments resulted in a RM7.3 billion impairment provision for 2018.“Roughly half” of the RM7.3 billion impairment was due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which Khazanah nationalised in 2014 after paying RM1.4 billion for the remaining 30% stake it did not own.Had that sizeable impairment for the loss-making national carrier been deemed necessary in 2017, Khazanah’s total impairment that year would have been nearer to RM5.95 billion — more than double the RM2.3 billion it booked that year. An impairment of that size would have wiped out the fund’s RM2.896 billion pre-tax profits for 2017 and resulted in two straight years of losses, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. Kitchen-sinking?Khazanah does not expect any large impairments to take place this year, even as Malaysia Airlines goes through another round of strategic review to improve its performance.“Khazanah should be able to return to profit [in 2019], given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books,” managing director Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said on March 5 when presenting the company’s annual review. He also provided more details on its dual-basket — strategic and commercial — investment fund structure, objectives and targets.The sovereign wealth fund will need at least five to seven years to rebalance its portfolio into one that can sustainably provide consistent supplementary income to the government, Shahril told The Edge in a recent interview. Apart from supporting the government’s developmental goals via its strategic investments, its commercial fund will be more diversified in terms of asset allocation, sector and geography.As it is, its portfolio concentration risk can also be seen from its so-called net worth adjusted (NWA) value where one-third of the RM25 billion or 21.6% year-on-year decline to RM91 billion as at end-2018 came from two companies — Axiata Group Bhd (-RM5 billion) and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (-RM3.5 billion).Other sizeable downward NWA adjustments were made for its holdings in Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-RM1.5 billion) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-RM200 million). The six made up RM14 billion or 56% of Khazanah’s NWA decline. Domestic factors, dealsWhile global markets underperformed last year on the back of geopolitical tension and pessimism over growth in emerging markets, Khazanah’s portfolio performance was further hampered by domestic developments, including regulatory changes, subdued earnings outlook and market volatility.To be sure, the headline RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 are sizeable.Still, the RM7.3 billion (non-cash) impairment does not affect Khazanah’s cash flow position and capacity to pay RM1.5 billion in dividend for 2018. The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends and booked RM1.4 billion divestment gains last year, down from RM3.1 billion in dividends and RM2.8 billion divestment gains in 2017.Khazanah paid RM30 million in dividend in 2005 when it reported a RM831 million pre-tax loss. It paid RM100 million in dividend in 2008 when it reported a RM223 million net loss in 2018. For 2019, the guidance is for “RM1 billion to RM1.5 billion” in dividend.It is understood that Khazanah’s sale of a 16% stake in IHH to Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM8.42 billion, which is targeted to be completed by end-March, is still awaiting foreign regulatory approval. According to Shahril, the proceeds will be used to rebalance its portfolio to generate greater returns for the country.A separate 26% stake in IHH is up for sale at the right price, as long as it does not destroy the value of the remaining holdings in Khazanah’s commercial basket. Other assets in the basket include its holdings in CIMB, Axiata and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Co, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.Meanwhile, assets in its strategic basket are Malaysia Airlines, Telekom Malaysia, Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia Airports and PLUS Malaysia Bhd. Developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd (TARH), Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd are also in this basket where economic benefits to the country also count as returns.It remains to be seen if UK-listed Merlin Entertainments plc, which makes money from operating Le­goland Malaysia on behalf of TARH, would buy a stake in the asset from Khazanah — just like how Mitsui had increased its stake in IHH by buying more shares from Kha­zanah. Talk of the potential sale of Legoland or an IPO of Khazanah’s theme parks had been circulating for some years.While Shahril said Khazanah was “not in talks with anyone and there are no offers on the table” when asked about the sale of Le­goland, he did not dismiss the possibility. “Everything has a value at the end of the day and if a great valuation comes in, we will look and see whether the capital that can be returned to our books can be better deployed in other areas,” he said, noting that Legoland is already profitable.Apart from behaving more like a portfolio manager to derive greater returns on its commercial assets, Khazanah is also targeting better cost-efficiency by cutting its cost-to-realisable asset value (RAV) ratio from 50 basis points in 2018 to 30 to 35 basis points in 2023. Part of this could come as it vacates premium office space at the Petronas Twin Towers in favour of transit-oriented Mercu UEM in KL Sentral. Khazanah, which has a long-term lease for 11,500 sq ft at The Shard in London, also has offices in Istanbul, Beijing, Mumbai and San Francisco.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example … we need people on the ground to ensure those assets are managed well and are creating value for Khazanah as a whole.

125,"March 18, 2019 16:00 pm +08",PETRONAS,"Petronas ramps up capex, to be upstream-heavy this year ","PETROLIAM Nasional Bhd (Petronas) expects its capital expenditure this year to be “slightly above RM50 billion” , with a “fair share” allocated for the upstream segment.This compares with capex of RM46.8 billion last year, up 5.17% compared with FY2017.In particular, the national oil company expects to spend RM30 billion on upstream activities this year, with around half of it slated for the domestic front.This follows the near-completion of its US$27 billion Pengerang Integrated Complex, says Petronas president and group executive Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin.“Essentially, upstream will have its fair share going forward,” he says at a news conference on Petronas’ financial results for the year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018).“We are also venturing into the new energy space  and that will also take up some of our capex [in 2019].”He confirms that India is one of the oil company’s areas of exploration in renewables, particularly in the solar energy segment.“This is an ongoing exercise. There are many opportunities that we have screened, and India is one of them,” says Wan Zulkiflee, in response to a question on whether Petronas is buying into Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt Ltd, one of India’s largest rooftop solar power producers.It was reported in January that Petronas was in talks with private equity firm I Squared Capital to buy a majority stake in Amplus — which has 350mw of solar power generation capacity — in a deal that could be worth RM1.56 billion.For the fourth quarter, Petronas saw a 21.34% year-on-year decrease in profit after tax (PAT) to RM14.32 billion, partly due to higher product costs and higher depreciation and amortisation of its upstream assets.“We took the opportunity to look at our provisioning for our [upstream] decommissioning, dismantlement, removal and restoration [in 4QFY2018],” says Petronas chief financial officer Tengku Muhammad Taufik Tengku Aziz.This was despite quarterly revenue rising 13.14% y-o-y to RM69.9 billion, mainly due higher average realised prices, which offset lower sales volume for liquefied natural gas.PAT for FY2018 rose 21.51% y-o-y to RM55.31 billion on the back of higher revenue and supported by net write-back of impairment of assets.These were partially offset by higher net product and production costs, depreciation and amortisation as well as tax expenses.Revenue rose 12.23% y-o-y to RM250.98 billion. Of FY2018 revenue, 69% was obtained domestically while the rest came from overseas.For this year, Petronas has planned its operations with the dated Brent average benchmarked at US$66 per barrel. Brent crude averaged US$71.04 per barrel last year.Group cash and cash equivalents as at end-FY2018 rose to RM173.58 billion from RM128.21 billion previously. The group is sticking to its dividend payout to the government of RM54 billion, as projected earlier.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/petronas-ramps-capex-be-upstreamheavy-year,"2019-05-01 20:04:16"
126,"March 18, 2019 16:00 pm +08",PETRONAS,"Non-payment of small vendors hinders O&G recovery ","AFTER a long and tedious wait, the country’s oil and gas (O&G) services companies are finally beginning to enjoy the benefits of better crude oil prices and increased upstream spending by oil majors.But while some listed companies have started to see a positive turnaround in the latest results season, The Edge has learnt that some smaller vendors have yet to be paid, even though they have completed their subcontracts.“Sorry to say [but] some OGSE (oil and gas services and equipment) companies are having problems getting their payments down the line,” says an executive at an offshore services company.“This does not happen with the NOCs or IOCs (national or international oil companies), but it is more on the part of the main contractors.”Late payments to smaller vendors in the sector have been occurring for decades, information gathered by The Edge reveals.However, it has got worse following the prolonged oil price downturn in 2015, and unfortunately, shows no signs of improvement despite the nascent recovery in the sector.Delayed payments could put a dent in Petroliam Nasional Bhd’s (Petronas) consolidation agenda.According to Petronas president and group chief executive Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, the norm is for Petronas to pay the main contractors as they are its “single point of contact”.That payment is then to be made down the line to the subcontractors. However, when certain main contractors do not keep their end of the bargain, subcontractors may no longer wish to participate, never mind consider mergers and consolidation.The payout may be small relative to the main contractor’s finances, but it is critical for small and medium enterprises. Halting payment amounts to tightening the cash flow — the lifeblood of a company.The national oil and gas company is cognisant of the problem. “We are pretty conscious; we know about the cash flow issue faced by some of our service providers,” Wan Zulkiflee said at Petronas’ FY2018 results briefing last Friday.“On our part, we do take this into account [in] our selection of main contractors [based] on their previous [payout] performance,” he says, adding that Petronas does intervene in some contracts.However, sometimes its hands are tied.“The main contractors are our single point of contact, [and] there are certain terms in the contract that sometimes restrict us from full intervention. So, it is kind of on a contract-by-contract [basis], but we are fully aware of this issue, [and] we have taken initiatives.”Separately, last year, Petronas initiated a matchmaking scheme, called the Vendor Financing Programme, under which seven financial institutions have been roped in to provide vendors easier access to financing.“Essentially, all these efforts are to ease the cash-flow problems faced by subcontractors,” Wan Zulkiflee says.The industry executive confirms that Petronas has intervened in the past and that certain small vendors managed to bypass the main contractors to be paid directly by Petronas and its partners.“We also understand the grievances … for main contractors, the rates are still low. They show profit on paper but cash flow is another issue altogether.“But [the non-payment] is a valid complaint,” the executive says.Malaysia has in excess of 2,700 active O&G companies, most of which are SMEs. Fewer than 50 are listed on Bursa Malaysia.Previously, Petronas had said it would leave industry restructuring and consolidation to market forces as less capable SMEs are expected to drop out and the more capable ones emerge stronger in the long run.This year, Petronas expects to allocate RM15 billion out of “slightly over RM50 billion” in capital expenditure for the domestic upstream segment, up from around RM12 billion last year.But if the issue of non-payment of smaller players persists, O&G SMEs — including the better ones — may end up adrift due to cash-flow concerns, preventing the successful implementation of Petronas’ agenda to build a stronger O&G industry for the future. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/nonpayment-small-vendors-hinders-og-recovery,"2019-05-01 20:04:16"

(March 15, 36.5 sen)
Upgrade to buy from hold with a higher fair value (FV) of 50 sen: Sapura Energy Bhd’s (Sapura) FV of 50 sen, from an earlier 30 sen, is based on a lower 30% discount to our estimated diluted book value of 72 sen per share, following the completion of its RM4 billion rights issue. 
Our earlier concerns on the 18.5% under subscription or 1.8 billion ordinary shares out of the RM3 billion rights shares issued at 30 sen per share on a five-for-three basis have been alleviated as the underwriters Maybank Investment Bank, CIMB Investment Bank and RHB Investment Bank have completely disposed of the shares without causing any significant price swings.Also, we have become more confident of Sapura’s improving earnings prospects which currently stem overseas, principally in the Middle East, Brazil, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. Selected as one of Saudi Aramco’s four new long-term agreement programme contractors late last year, substantive order book expansions are still likely from Sapura’s current tender book of US$8.5 billion (about RM34.77 billion.) with prospective bids of US$14.3 billion (about RM58.5 billion).These are highlighted in Sapura’s new orders worth RM9.3 billion for financial year 2019 (FY19) to date, which translate into 2.3 times the RM2.8 billion jobs clinched in FY18 and an outstanding order book of RM17.7 billion — three times FY20 forecast revenues.In January this year, Sapura secured three rig drilling charters and two offshore jobs worth RM760 million that include carrying out the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning works related to relocating and tying in Petronas floating LNG Satu from the Kanowit field to the Kebabangan cluster off Sabah, with completion expected in the third quarter of financial year 2020 (3QFY20).The group’s yard’s utilisation is expected to surge 5.8 times from 5,000 tonnes in 2018 to 29,000 tonnes in 2019 and subsequently accelerate further by 28% to 37,000 tonnes in 2020, driven by the progress completion of the Pegaga and ONGC’s KG-DWN- 98/2 central processing platform projects, coupled with the three wellhead platforms for the Sapura-OMV’s Gorek, Bakong and Larak wellhead platforms. Our only concern is the group’s drilling division as its rig utilisation rate of below 50% currently will continue to drag the group’s overall improving earnings prospects.Together with the completion of the sale of a 50% equity stake in Sapura Upstream to Austria-based OMV Aktiengesellschaft (OMV) for an enterprise value of US$1.6 billion (about RM6.5 billion.), we expect Sapura’s net profit to surge by 2.2 times for FY20F and 46% for FY21F from substantive cuts in interest costs, partly offset by the upstream earnings deconsolidation. Additionally, this will cut the group’s FY20F net gearing from 1.7 times to a comfortable 0.5 times. — AmInvestment Bank, March 15",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/surge-sapura-energys-profit-seen-sapura-upstream-stake-sale,"2019-05-01 20:04:17"
128,"March 18, 2019 07:00 am +08",PETRONAS,"Building trust is not just the CEO’s job","For businesses and corporates, trust is a powerful currency that is often attached to their management’s reputation, among other things.Hence the aftermath of the 14th general election (GE14) in May 2018, when Corporate Malaysia saw many abrupt changes at the helm of larger companies that, eventually, turned the spotlight on the affected businesses.Among the questions that arose were how should companies protect the trust they have amid unplanned leadership shifts, and how should they mitigate any impact on confidence such changes has had.The answer is to consider the long-term effect when it comes to trust, according to PwC Malaysia managing partner Sridharan Nair, or Sri as he is known.An organisation that has built up its reservoir of trust and embedded it as part of corporate values can stand the test of time regardless of leadership changes, Sri explains.“There is a saying that consistency is the true foundation of trust. So if you do not have that consistency in an organisation, then this raises doubts [among stakeholders].“So, a balance has to be struck — the person whose face is on the front is the leader, but it is the organisation which [provides support], so it is not just what the leader says but how the group behaves as well,” he adds.That said, the onus of building confidence — or renewing it, as the case may be — lies with a company’s management that is often seen as its face as well.And the leader needs the backing of the organisation to be successful in doing that, says Sri.“The tone at the top needs to be set, essentially, to say ‘we need to promote integrity at the highest levels all the way through the organisation’,” he tells The Edge.“However, it is not just about rolling out a plan or initiative; it is how you see it through, from the actions to the enforcement of it [throughout the organisation],” he adds.The growing spotlight on the role of leadership in trust is accorded consideration in the PwC Malaysia Building Trust Awards, which returns this year for the third time since its inaugural edition back in 2015.The biennial awards recognise companies that are making significant moves in building integrity through their communications and interactions with stakeholders.To recap, no submissions or nominations are accepted for the awards. Instead, only the top 50 Malaysian public-listed companies (PLCs) on Bursa Malaysia by market capitalisation are considered.The annual reports of these 50 companies are then benchmarked against the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework (refer to Methodology). This would be based on the latest available annual reports as of June 2018. Following this, a total of 20 companies are then shortlisted. For this year, the 20 finalists listed in alphabetical order are: AirAsia Group Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, BIMB Holdings Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Digi.com Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, KLCCP Stapled Group, Malayan Banking Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Maxis Bhd, MISC Bhd, Petronas, RHB Bank Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Sunway Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.PwC Malaysia assurance and people partner Pauline Ho says on top of the existing assessment methodology, an additional survey was introduced this year as part of three dimensions of measuring trust perception in collaboration with The Iclif Leadership and Governance Centre (Iclif).According to Ho, the extra survey looks at trust in leadership as the first dimension. The review is designed for an organisation’s employees to answer questions surrounding leadership and their confidence in their company’s leadership team.For the second dimension, PwC conducts an independent survey via a third party to comb through online sources of data for conversations about trust on the 20 shortlisted organisations in order to build a trust profile for each.“The third dimension is a public poll, which is open to the public until March 31, 2019, where we get anyone who is not working within the organisation to comment on whether these [companies] are building trust,” says Ho.“[Through this] we have these different perspectives so that we not only listen to what the companies say about themselves, but also what employees think about their leadership and what the third parties are saying, as well as the public opinion,” Ho concludes.The findings will then be deliberated on by an independent panel of four judges who will select the winners.Rounding up the 2019 Building Trust Awards panel of judges are Sir David Tweedie who is the chairman of the board of trustees of the International Valuation Standards Council and past chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board; Tan Sri Dr Jemilah Mahmood who is under secretary general, partnerships at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; Malek Ali, who is the founder of BFM 89.9; and Nadiah Wan, the group CEO of TMC Life Sciences Bhd and CEO of the Thomson Hospital, Kota Damansara.The results will be revealed at an awards ceremony to be held in Kuala Lumpur, which is scheduled to take place in the second half of the year.This year, PwC also engaged the growing start-up community to understand their perspective on trust. However, start-up organisations are not part of the awards, which are currently meant for PLCs only.From the engagement, it is clear that large corporates can draw important lessons from start-ups on how to protect trust, which is vital to any start-up’s long-term survival, says Sri.“If they (start-ups) cannot get that (trust management) right, they believe that they are not going to be able to survive as a business. And I think that is probably a lesson for larger corporates where as you get bigger, you may have other priorities such as expansion or other engagement with stakeholders and shareholders as opposed to which segment actually makes your business work, which is the consumers who buy your products or services,” says Sri.“So we have seen the larger corporates refocusing on consumers and customers over the years. Their focus is on consumers and making sure that they get their consumers to believe in their idea and to address and to be very responsive to those consumers’ comments as well,” he adds.Interestingly, many start-ups feel that it is easier to boost trust as a big business, Sri reflects. On the other hand, start-ups also believe they can build up their trust reservoir through technology much faster, he adds.“They also believe that in the start-up phase, they can connect with the consumers quicker and in a more authentic manner than much more established businesses.“And, for established businesses, when you go into something that is new, it is more difficult to build trust because you are seen as this sort of business and doing this sort of thing, [but] trying to venture into something new.”In any case, the growing trust awareness in the business ecosystem in Malaysia is positive given that the private sector is a key driver of the economy, Sri says.“At the end of the day, it is about having businesses, corporates and start-ups, having the dialogue and discussion about the importance of trust. Businesses have a big role to play, and if we are able to raise the bar on how important trust is, then we are heading in the right direction.”To participate in the online poll, please visit http://bit.ly/pwctrustpoll 2019. CEOs weigh in on trust...As a leader, how do you inspire a culture of trust in Maybank?
Trust is ultimately about aligning personal and collective interests of a group to a pre-agreed destination — relying on each individual to do his part, so that the outcome is greater than the sum of the parts. The challenge is to ensure agreement among members that group interests should always take precedence over personal ones. It is ultimately a balancing act that needs to be monitored constantly.— Datuk Abdul Farid Alias,
Group President & CEO,
Malayan Banking Bhd (winning company of the 2015 awards) How did Sime Darby Group sustain employee trust amidst the leadership changes following the demerger?
With the new leadership team in place, we set out to meet with groups of employees across our operations. These sessions were essentially open platforms for employees to air any concerns or questions they had, and for them to share their thoughts and ideas for the new organisation. They also provided us the opportunity to communicate our new vision, strategy and targets, and to project the new culture for Sime Darby Bhd.  — Datuk Jeffri Salim Davidson,
Group CEO,
Sime Darby Bhd (winning company of the 2017 awards) How can leaders articulate trust in a simple yet meaningful manner to their employees?  
For leaders to express trust to their employees, there must be commitment to a purpose that entails creating a better future for their people. Not only is it important for employees to know that their leader is committed to a worthy purpose; the leader must pursue that purpose based on the right set of values.  Deeply held values play a huge role in earning trust. Earning the trust of one’s employees is not just a soft, nice-to-have asset; it is the hard currency that makes a difference between success and failure.How can leaders build trust for their organisation’s long-lasting success?
Leaders build trust for their organisations through their actions – by setting direction that creates meaningful value for their stakeholders and enables empowered decision-making. In addition, leaders focus on designing the structures, deploying the right resources and supporting systems to execute the strategy. Underpinning all this, is the accountability for creating a culture of long-lasting excellence based on the right values and leading by example.—  Rajeev Peshawaria,

129,"March 16, 2019 18:00 pm +08",PETRONAS,"Opportunities in a stagnant market in 2019","It is no secret that the local property market is facing trying times. This is evidenced by the decline in the volume and value of property transactions last year.Despite the sluggishness, there are still some pockets of opportunities, according to consultants and speakers at the 12th Malaysian Property Summit held on Feb 21. The summit was organised by the Association of Valuers, Property Managers, Estate Agents and Property Consultants in the Private Sector Malaysia.Titled “Property Market Outlook 2019”, the summit examined the local property market in segments such as residential, office, retail and specialised asset class for REITs as well as markets in the northern and southern regions, and housing changes under the new government. Here are some key takeaways from the summit. Overall market performanceValuation and Property Services Department director-general Ahmad Zailan Azizuddin said the residential segment is still leading. “Residential continues to lead the overall market,” he said in his presentation entitled “Overview of the Malaysian property market”.“In terms of transaction value, the residential segment saw a drop of 3.9% to RM33.1 billion in 3Q2018 from a year ago.”In terms of volume, it took up 63.4%, followed by agricultural (20.8%), commercial (7.7%), development land and others (6.1%) and industrial (2%).“The residential market recorded a 5.1% increase in transaction value to RM17.79 billion,” said Zailan.Between 1Q2018 and 3Q2018, the number of new launches declined 23.6%. “Selangor remained the leading state for new launches (14.7%). Condominiums and apartments formed the bulk of these launches (35.2%), followed by 2 and 3-storey terraced houses (29.5%),” he said. The sales of the new launches stood at 30.1%.“Unsold and overhang of properties have become a hot issue. National Property Information Centre has launched the Unsold Property Enquiry System Malaysia to provide information on this. The government is also taking steps to tackle the problem with the Home Ownership Campaign 2019.”“Unsold completed residential units continued to increase (by 21.7%) — 30,115 units in 3Q2018. Condominiums and apartments formed the bulk of the numbers at 39.5% (11,908 units).“The states with high overhang were Johor (6,053 units), Selangor (4,524) and Perak (3,612).“Properties priced between RM500,001 and RM1 million saw the highest increase in overhang numbers,” Zailan added.Meanwhile, the Malaysian House Price Index showed a positive sign with the average price of properties at RM414,469. The average price for terraced houses was RM377,001 while that for high-rises was RM334,821.In the commercial segment, the transaction value contracted 4.5% to RM5.53 billion in 3Q2018, said Zailan.“As at 3Q2018, a huge future supply is coming from Kuala Lumpur — 1,795,149 sq m (30 buildings) of 3,147,356 sq m (93 buildings).”Major contributors to space in 3Q2018 were Kuala Lumpur (40.9%), Selangor (17.2%), Putrajaya (10.3%) and Johor (5.2%). Putrajaya remained the main contributor to space for government use. Meanwhile, purpose-built offices showed an overall occupancy of 82.7%.As for the future supply of space in shopping complexes, there will be 2,964,406 sq m (83 buildings). “Shopping complexes recorded 79.1% overall occupancy in 3Q2018,” said Zailan.He added that 3Q2018 transactions in the industrial segment amounted to RM3.5 billion while those in the agricultural market saw an 18.4% decline to RM2.86 billion.On the outlook for the property market this year, he said the situation is expected to stabilise.“The government is aware of the homeownership problem,” Zailan said. It is rebranding  RUMAWIP as Residensi Wilayah with several improvements. A committee is needed to monitor the cost of development to make home prices affordable. Affordable housing remains the top priority of the government, he added. “The commercial segment remains the pull factor for investments while the industrial segment is expected to play a significant role in generating investments.”Rahim & Co International Sdn Bhd director of research Sulaiman Saheh concurs. In his presentation entitled “Residential market performance and outlook”, he said, “With new policies to address the issue of affordability, we hope to see more stringent implementation. The market has swayed towards the affordable segment. Creative products in this segment will be well received.“The volume and value of overhang in the residential market are at their highest. There is an even spread between the number of overhang units priced below RM500,000 and over RM500,000.He noted signs of price consolidation in areas such as Mont’Kiara, Bangsar-KL Sentral, KLCC and Bukit Jalil. “On the national level, there is a product mismatch, with most of the transactions being below RM500,000 whereas the bulk of the overhang is priced above [RM500,000].“The number of launches and the sales performance of developers have been declining. However, there are projects that are performing well due to their concept and location as well as the developers’ marketing strategies.” Pockets of opportunitiesJones Lang Wootton executive director Malathi Thevendran, in her presentation entitled “Office market performance and outlook”, said, “There will be 22.962 million sq ft of office space with 29% under construction post-2021.” There will be continued downward pressure on buildings with poor occupancy, she added.“We have to keep abreast of the office market trend. With infrastructure improvements, subcommercial locations have emerged (apart from the central business district and Golden Triangle areas), and this is where the new supply will be and the developers will be focusing on.“Another area to look at is co-working space. But will this stand the test of time? Based on my observation, some are doing well while others have closed down or consolidated. However, there is still potential [for this segment to do well]. Not all of [the co-working spaces] are housed in purpose-built office buildings.”Malathi predicted that the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) (2.65 million sq ft) will take quite a while to achieve full occupancy. She said Jones Lang Wootton took about 10 years to achieve full occupancy for the Petronas Twin Towers.“The second tower of the Petronas Twin Towers with total space of 1.25 million sq ft only reached full occupancy after 10 years. The first tower was already pre-committed to Petronas, but the balance [of 1.25 million sq ft] took a decade to achieve 90% take-up in 2008,” she said.Although there were pre-commitments by HSBC, Prudential and Affin Bank to take up space at TRX for their headquarters, only 15% of the total space has been committed to so far, she added. “Pre-commitment is something that needs to be looked at.”In his presentation entitled “Retail market performance and outlook”, Savills Malaysia head of retail services Murli Menon emphasised the importance of the millennials in the retail market.“Currently, there are two billion millennials in Asia. In 2025, 76% of the global workforce will be millennials.“Online marketing is creating a structural shift, but the bulk of retail sales will still take place in stores. It is not about online versus offline. It is [about] how the two can work together,” he said, adding that it is important to future-proof the market for the millennials and post-millennials.“We are seeing a return to the customer-centric approach where engagement and convenience are important, not the channel of purchase. Millennials and post-millennials will shape the retail landscape going forward.”Grocery, beauty, leisure and food and beverage are the most defensive segments to online migration, he added.Alpha REIT Managers Sdn Bhd chairman Datuk Stewart Labrooy, in his presentation entitled “Specialised alternative asset classes for real estate investment trusts”, said the industrial REIT segment is still the front runner and best-performing asset class. “The stock availability [of industrial REITs] is still tight. Rents have been rising 30% over the past two years. Industrial land prices have also been climbing, leading to the introduction of new innovative multi-level distribution centres.”He said e-commerce is driving the demand and supply of industrial REITs. “Demand for new, high-quality industrial estates will transform the industrial landscape. They are offering industrial REITs much larger assets.“Moving forward yields will be higher ... providing REITs with higher yields (7% and above), long leases and stable revenue. The long-term outlook for this sector is bright.”Labrooy also spoke on the emerging REIT asset classes, particularly education, self-storage and even student housing. “According to a CIMB Education Report in 2014, 100 new schools will be needed to accommodate the growth [of the education segment].Meanwhile, self-storage facilities have become a popular niche for real estate investors, and self-storage REITs naturally followed.The potential for further share price growth plus dividend income is a big draw for REIT investors, hence, self-storage holds a lot of promise, he said. “As for student housing, the likely acquisition driver is that REITs are good defensive plays, that is, student housing tends to do well, no matter where the cycle is as students will always go to college even during downturns.”CBRE | WTW partner and Penang branch director Peh Seng Yee, in his presentation entitled “Regional market performance and outlook: Penang”, highlighted that Penang currently offers a good bargain for purchasers. “Prices of landed homes have remained firm, with some price corrections for some apartment and condominium schemes.“Various incentives will continue to be offered by developers and further price corrections for apartments and condos on the secondary market may occur. This is an opportune time to buy.”According to Peh, the catalyst for the Penang market would be the Penang Transport Master Plan and land reclamation. Some of the next growth areas in the state include Timur Laut, Barat Daya, Seberang Perai Utara and Seberang Perai Selatan.CBRE | WTW partner and Johor branch director Tan Ka Leong listed the Johor-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) and Iskandar Malaysia Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as the catalysts for developments in Johor in his presentation entitled “Regional market performance and outlook: Johor”.“The Johor-Singapore RTS will connect Bukit Chagar to Woodland North in Singapore and is initially targeted to be completed by 2024.

Profitability was driven by additional Starbucks café openings, better performance from KRR, and strong same-store sales growth (SSSG) in both Starbucks (8.0%) and KRR (2.5%) operations. The commendable Starbucks SSSG figure was due to the successful introduction of new product offerings and merchandising.Gan said that overall, Berjaya Food will continue growing its top line by opening 25-30 new Starbucks outlets annually and 50 Starbucks kiosks at Petronas petrol stations, as part of their partnership with Petronas.“Furthermore, we are greatly encouraged by KRR Malaysia’s turnaround, resulting from streamlining of menu items and closing of unprofitable outlets.“Note that KRR Malaysia posted a marginal profit in 3QFY19, after losses of RM6.7 million in FY18,” Gan said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/berjaya-food-596-firmer-3q-earnings-dividend,"2019-05-01 20:04:19"

(March 13, RM17.70)
Maintained hold and a lower target price of  RM17.30: Petronas Gas Bhd (PetGas) is currently operating under the new gas transportation tariff in 2019 (known as the pilot year), while it is in the midst of submitting a proposed tariff for first regulatory period (RP1) (2020-2022) to the Energy Commission following the implementation of third-party access. PetGas will also be gradually migrating from a depreciated replacement cost approach to net book value as the regulated assest base (RAB). This has a greater impact on its gas transportation business (which made up 40% of total 2018 operating profit) due to the lower net book value of its Peninsular Gas Utilisation pipeline network as compared to its regasification assets, which are relatively newer.The Energy Commission has lowered the incentive-based regulation (IBR) tariff following the TPA implementation for Peninsular gas utilisation (from RM1.248 per gigaJoule (GJ) to RM1.072/GJ, Sungai Udang regasification terminal to RM3.518 per one million British thermal units (mmBtu) and Pengerang regasification terminal to US$0.637 per mmBtu. Based on our estimates, this could have a 7% impact on the regasification business in 2019, which makes up 25% of the business.We cut our 2019-2020E earnings by 4%-8% to factor in the pilot gas transportation tariff in 2019 and a further earnings step-down based on the revised IBR in RP1. We maintain our “hold” call but lower our target price to RM17.30 (adjusting for a higher weighted average cost of capital of 7.8% from 7.1% and a lower terminal growth from 2% to 1%). PetGas currently pays among the highest dividends of Petronas listed companies. Notwithstanding the current situation, we believe the dividend payout would sustain at a similar 70% level going forward. The current about 4% dividend yield will likely lend support to the share price, thus we see limited downside risk from current levels.Key upside/downside risks to our call falls on the outcome of the allowable return to be tabled to the Energy Commission. Downside risks also include any unforeseen operational disruption of the existing assets. — Affin Hwang Capital Research, March 13",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/petgas-likely-maintain-dividend-payout-similar-70-level,"2019-05-01 20:04:21"

Gandingan Mentari and Ihsan Perdana are subsidiaries of SRC.He produced related documents — including memorandums of association, articles of association and financial accounts — of these companies.He testified that SRC was formed in January 2011 by its directors, Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil and Vincent Koh Beng Huat. In August 2011, 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) took control by putting RM1 million into the RM2 company. SRC was placed under the Ministry of Finance with Nik Faisal and Datuk Suboh Mohd Yasin remaining as directors last year. 2     Azizul Adzani Abdul Ghafar, 41, Bank Negara Malaysia managerAzizul testified that on July 6, 2015, he was asked by Bank Negara investigating officer Ahmad Farhan Sharifuddin to lead a raid, with three colleagues, on AmBank in Jalan Raja Chulan, Kuala Lumpur. After waiting for about 12 hours, they retrieved details and documents related to Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s accounts, SRC and Gandingan Mentari.The documents were handed over by AmBank branch manager R Uma Devi and were placed in eight coloured folders. Azizul told the court that Uma Devi also provided documents on the alleged transactions done by Najib in his accounts.He also revealed that apart from  his team, another group also raided the bank on the 24th floor that day and that the officers and other investigators came in four to five cars.He added that Ahmad Farhan said the investigation and raid was being done under Part IV of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001, which spells out the central bank’s requirement for financial institutions to report any suspicious activities. Following the raid, he lodged a report under Section 4 of the act for money laundering that night (July 6, 2015), based on the documents seized. 3     Mohammad Nizam Yahya, 39, analyst and Intelligence officer with Bank Negara’s Monetary Investigation and Enforcement DepartmentNizam testified that he was instructed by his department head, Abdul Rahman Abu Bakar, to lead a three-member team to retrieve documents from Affin Bank in Jalan Raja Chulan in relation to Ihsan Perdana on July 6, 2015.Nizam met Affin Bank head of advisory and company secretarialship, Nimma Safira Khalid, who then provided him with documents related to Ihsan Perdana on July 7, 9, 10 and 13, 2015.He made copies of the documents and gave them to the 1MDB special task force that year. He later gave the original documents to Wong Chiew Hoong, an officer in MACC’s special investigation division. 4     Ahmad Farhan Sharifuddin, 32, Bank Negara managerThe investigating officer in the AmBank raid said there were actually three teams that conducted the raid and that he had been directed by Bank Negara director Abdul Rahman Abu Bakar, who also gave him the account numbers to look for.He described July 6, 2015, as “memorable”, and he then identified and verified the documents that had been marked.During cross-examination by Harvinderjit Singh, the witness admitted that he had the BlackBerry seized from AmBank account relationship manager Joanna Yu as well as other documents. However, the witness said he did not know that Yu had had an exchange with Jho Low, whose real name is Low Taek Jho.This prompted the defence to ask Ahmad Farhan to produce Yu’s phone and a transcript of the purported conversation she had had with Jho Low. The defence cited the book Billion Dollar Whale, which had referred to a transcript of a text message exchange between Yu and Jho Low on a BlackBerry. The defence, through lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, also gave Attorney-General Tommy Thomas’ article, written when he was a lawyer, as grounds for the prosecution to produce the items.Following lengthy arguments from the defence and prosecution, who had asked the former to show the relevancy of the items sought, judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali agreed to allow the defence’s request and directed Ahmad Farhan to produce them. 5     Badrul Hisam Mohamad, 42, senior manager of AmBank cheque-processing departmentBadrul’s role is to process and give value to cheques issued by customers of AmBank and AmBank Islamic. During the trial, he explained the technical cheque-clearing process.Individuals and companies can only issue cheques from current accounts. The account holder does this by signing the cheques while company cheques can be signed by directors or authorised signatories, he explained.Badrul declared that 16 AmBank cheques produced in court and issued in 2014 and 2015 were “good for payment”. Najib issued 15 of the cheques, totalling RM10.77 million, from his accounts during the period while SRC issued one, transferring RM20 million to its subsidiary, Ihsan Perdana. One must refer to bank statements or successful inward clearing item reports to determine if the cheques have been cleared, he said.Badrul also confirmed that millions of ringgit were deposited into and withdrawn from Najib’s AmIslamic Bank account between 2013 and 2015. In one cheque for RM3.5 million issued to Hafarizam Wan & Aisha Mubarak, the receiving CIMB Bank mistakenly encoded it as RM3,500. It took six days before the transaction could be concluded.He explained that when a cheque hits a negative balance, the AmBank relationship manager in charge of that account — if available — will communicate with the account holder or his nominee for further deliberation. Communications are carried out via official channels only. BlackBerry? “Not that I know of,” said Badrul. 6     Zulkarnain Mohamad, 46, interior designer with ABS Trend Master Sdn BhdZulkarnain, who is a permanent resident, told the court that he received a call from one Amirul, the prime minister’s residence manager, asking him to carry out renovations at Najib’s Jalan Langgak Duta home.He testified that Amirul took him to the house in September or October 2014, and he was asked to build a storeroom for Najib and his family to store their clothes. Work expanded to renovating the guardhouse used by the police and repairing the place where garbage is placed, he said.He testified that he charged RM243,000 for the work and he received a RM100,000 cheque from Najib’s account and deposited it into the company’s account. He said although initially promising to complete the work in three to four months, the renovation was completed within two to three months. 7       Mohamad Zakariya Zearat Khan, 35, owner of MOZ (M) Sdn BhdZakariya testified that he was called in by Amirul to look into the frequent water disruptions at Najib’s Jalan Langgak Duta residence and, being a Syabas contractor, he suggested that a water tank be built on the grounds.His company charged RM56,500 for the work.

139,"April 30, 2019 18:00 pm +08",CIMB,"MRCB seeks expressions of interest for Menara Celcom in PJ ","MALAYSIAN Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB), the developer and owner of Menara Celcom in PJ Sentral Garden City in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, has appointed at least six real estate agents to seek offers for the office building, which is estimated to be worth some RM500 million.The newly built 33-storey building sits on a 49,449 sq ft site. It offers 1.04 million sq ft in gross floor area and 450,000 sq ft in net lettable area.In a brief interview with The Edge, MRCB group chief operating officer Kwan Joon Hoe confirms the appointment of several real estate agents to seek expressions of interest (EOI) for Menara Celcom. An EOI is different from a sale by tender as it is generally non-binding. Under an EOI, both parties could decide not to proceed with the deal, for example.Kwan, however, points out that there is no urgency to sell the commercial asset and that MRCB will only sell it if the price is right.“We will test the market and [put out] feelers to decide what is the best price that we can sell it for. But it will not necessarily translate into a deal,” he explains.Once an offer is received, MRCB will present it to its board of directors, who will decide if the company should sell the asset or wait for yield appreciation. If MRCB decides to sell, as the sponsor of MRCB-Quill Real Estate Investment Trust (MQREIT), it will approach the REIT, which has the right of first refusal and the option of matching the offer price or offering a higher amount. If the REIT is not keen on the asset, MRCB can then sell it to the other party.While Kwan declines to reveal MRCB’s asking price, industry sources tell The Edge that the company is looking to sell the asset for RM500 million.The building, developed by MRCB’s wholly-owned subsidiary Puncak Wangi Sdn Bhd, was handed over to Celcom Axiata Bhd last September. Celcom has a 21-year lease (15 years with an option to extend the lease for two 3-year terms) on the building and is currently looking for tenants to fill 74,000 sq ft of space spread over five floors.It is learnt that under the lease agreement, the base rent will be revised on the 7th, 16th and 19th years while the service charge will increase by 10% every three years. Potential tenants have been told that the net rental is RM5.30 psf while the service charge is RM1.25 psf.If the RM5.30 psf net rental is anything to go by, MRCB’s annual rental income from the building is an estimated RM28 million.Meanwhile, at RM500 million, the asking price for the 450,000 sq ft office space works out at RM1,100 psf and pegs the yield of the building at 5.3%. When asked to comment on feedback given by real estate agents contacted by The Edge, who opine that the asking price is on the high side in the current property market environment and that the price is more likely to be fetched by buildings in Kuala Lumpur city centre and not in Petaling Jaya, Kwan says MRCB has received positive offers. “It has not reached the mark we want but is not that far from our target.”In 2014, Danajamin Nasional Bhd tied up with CIMB Islamic Bank Bhd and RHB Islamic Bank Bhd to provide financing of RM420 million — comprising a Danajamin-guaranteed RM200 million eight-year Islamic medium-term notes (IMTN) programme and a RM220 million Islamic term loan facility provided jointly by the two banks — to Puncak Wangi to develop what is now known as Menara Celcom.According to a RAM Ratings report dated Sept 18, 2018, Puncak Wangi is highly leveraged with the bulk of the office tower’s development cost being funded by the Islamic bonds and bank loans. It says that by December 2018, the debt would be at RM420 million once the company fully draws down on its debt facility to fund the construction costs as well as to repay its debt obligations.“Puncak Wangi is highly dependent on the disposal of the office tower or refinancing to meet the bullet repayments on the principal of its IMTN and term loans. In view of the long-term lease with Celcom upon the project’s completion, and MRCB’s intention to inject its investment properties into the group’s REIT, the likelihood of the office tower being disposed of to the REIT is deemed high. In this regard, we highlight that any delay in disposal will result in the IMTN maturing in November 2019 and being rolled over,” RAM Ratings states.Kwan, however, says the rental income will be sufficient to service the sukuk should the building remain unsold.Meanwhile, the next building that is expected to be completed in PJ Sentral is a 30-storey tower built for Malaysia Building Society Bhd. MRCB is expected to hand it over to MBSB, which paid RM239.24 million for the building in 2014, by the end of this year.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mrcb-seeks-expressions-interest-menara-celcom-pj,"2019-05-01 20:04:24"
140,"April 30, 2019 17:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Are banks worth a second look as half of them fall below book? ","HALF of the banks listed on Bursa Malaysia have fallen below book value, prompting questions as to why and whether they now make for a more attractive investment case.Bank valuations are often tied to their returns, and if a bank does not generate a return on equity (ROE) of at least 10.5% to 11%, its valuation is likely to be below book, a senior banking analyst with a foreign research house observes.He says the key to value hunting when it comes to banks trading below book is to look for profit growth potential, coupled with the capacity to lighten up capital.Banks currently trading below book — based on the order of lowest valuation — are Affin Bank Holdings, AMMB Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Building Society Bhd (MBSB), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd.Of the lot, the banking analyst finds RHB attractive as it has room for improvement through profit growth as well as lightening up on capital and releasing more capital to shareholders, given that it has one of the highest common equity tier-1 (CET-1) ratio of 15.5%. “Even with the latest capital buffer requirement of between 0.5% and 1% for D-SIBs (domestic systemically important banks) and the countercyclical buffer, RHB has room to release surplus capital,” he says.(CET-1 is a component of tier-1 capital that consists mostly of common stock held by a bank or financial institution. Banks are expected to meet the minimum CET-1 ratio of 4.5%.)As for CIMB, he reckons value can emerge should the bank’s plan to grow its Indonesian business take off. “CIMB looks interesting too as the stock price has weakened a lot. Its prospect for growth is Indonesia — it is one of the biggest drivers for its Foward23 plan. The Indonesian election results with Jokowi (Joko Widodo) winning should help CIMB as one of the things he is supportive of is infrastructure growth, and with that, loan demand will increase.“Another upside for the Indonesian banking business is the potential of the central bank reducing interest rates. If that happens, it will be good for margins for the banks there, which is the reverse of Malaysia,” he adds.He explains that for Indonesia, in the event of a rate cut, not only do deposits reprice faster than loans but funding costs for banks also come down first compared with Malaysia, where deposits do not reprice as fast but loan yield comes off first.Aberdeen Standard Invesments investment manager Evan Cheah is adopting a wait-and-see approach. “CIMB will have to prove that it can walk the talk with its latest strategy. It is a tough industry. As for its Indonesian business, Jokowi’s win may help in terms of the economy, but that may only be for the short term. Fundamentally, CIMB in Indonesia has a lot to do to compete with the top four banks in the country. Can it compete with the bigger boys?”Banks may be trading below book, but focusing on the fundamentals is key, he stresses. “It’s not just about valuation but also what the management of these banks is doing, plus their earnings track record over the years.”On AMMB, the banking analyst opines that the sale of its insurance business could act as a key re-rating catalyst for the stock as “that would boost its capital and bring its ROE closer to 10%”.“We’ve seen AMMB make strides such as selling off its NPLs (non-performing loans) and [it has also] tidied up its non-core assets by disposing of some … that is positive,” says Cheah.As for MBSB, which merged with Asian Finance Bank last year, he is keeping an eye on how the newly merged entity will “propel itself to the next level and how long that will take”.Although Affin’s valuation is the lowest at 0.479 times book, it is seen as one of the weaker banks operationally. Industry observers and analysts agree that its competitive edge lies in its asset management segment. Why the divergence in value?Banking analysts say the divergence in valuations boils down to the ROE, with banks generating below 10.5% likely to trade below their book value.Looking at banks’ ROEs in the quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, there appears to be a correlation between ROE and stock valuation for most of the banks.Affin had the lowest ROE of 5.94% for FY2018, followed by AMMB at 8.2% (for the nine months to end-December 2018).MBSB’s ROE was 8.62% for FY2018 while CIMB is at 11.4% but excluding its one-off gains that year, achieved an ROE of 9.6%. RHB’s ROE stood at 10.3%.The order of ROE for this group of banks trading below book matches that of their price-to-book (P/B) ratios.Those trading above book value are Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, BIMB Holdings Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd and Public Bank Bhd. Aberdeen’s Cheah points out that most of these banks have posted decent earnings over a long-term horizon, and this is important.“Alliance, the smallest one that is punching above its weight, is one of two banks that have seen NIM (net interest margin) growth in the midst of an industry trend of narrowing margins. RHB is the other bank that is seeing its NIMs expand,” he says.“The overall banking sector is seeing intense competition in cost of funds.”ROEs and NIMs aside, another thing to bear in mind when it comes to banks and valuations is capital. “If a bank generates ROE but is undercapitalised, it is meaningless,” says the banking analyst.The ROE for the group of banks trading above book is not in the same order as their P/B ratios. BIMB has the highest ROE of 15.4% but comes in third, after Hong Leong and Public Bank, in terms of valuation.Interestingly, Alliance’s ROE of 10.3% — the same as RHB’s — falls below the analyst’s 10.5% benchmark and yet it trades above P/B at 1.13 times. However, this was for its nine months ended December 2018.The country’s biggest banking group, Maybank, recorded an ROE of 11.4%, slightly below Hong Leong’s 11.5%, for the six-month period ended December 2018.Public Bank is still the outperformer of the lot, commanding the highest valuation of 2.14 times P/B and registering an ROE of 14.8% for FY2018. The M&A angleCould more mergers and acquisitions be in the offing owing to lower valuations?The banking analyst indicates that it is likely, but points out that a lot hinges on pricing and timing.The proposed CIMB-RHB merger did not happen in 2014 owing to the wide valuation gap between them — 1.6 times P/B for CIMB and 1.2 times P/B for RHB — he says, but notes that both have similar valuations today with no premium to book.“It’s easier to do an M&A today,” he adds, stressing that there has to be value-add in merging. “It is about merging with a bank that will help you make a difference in counter-positioning … because if there isn’t, why go ahead with it?”Cheah believes an M&A exercise is likely to happen in the industry as “we are overbanked”.“Whether or not it will happen is tricky as we have seen two failed mergers in recent years. We are looking at the banks closely just because their valuations are attractive. Each of them has specific issues, so we are still cautious. Plus, there is the overall potential rate cut and should the FTSE downgrade happen ... those are also risks to consider,” he cautions of global index provider FTSE Russell’s threat to downgrade Malaysian government bonds in its World Government Bond Index in September. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/are-banks-worth-second-look-half-them-fall-below-book,"2019-05-01 20:04:24"

The research house maintained its hold call on the stock, with Gordon growth model (GGM)-based target price (TP) of RM24.40. HLIB also maintains its forecasts on the group's earnings.However, CIMB IB did not take the same view, highlighting that Public Bank's 1QFY19 net profit was below its expectations at 23% of its full year forecast, while noting that 1QFY19 net profit was in line with market expectations at 24.5% of Bloomberg consensus estimates, according to its research note.As a result, CIMB IB lowered its earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by 6% to 7% for the financial years 2019 to 2021 (FY19-2021), following a 3% to 4% cut in net interest income and a 7.6% to 8.5% cut in non-interest income, leading to a drop in its dividend discount model (DDM)-based TP to RM23.60, from RM25.70 previously.In its outlook on the counter, HLIB noted that Public Bank's ""low-key"" 2019 guidance is slowly coming to fruition and does not forecast a short-term major recovery in net interest margin (NIM) given diminishing flexibility in the optimisation of loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR), which is already high at 93%.""Unlike peers, Public Bank has not raised its base rate and base lending rate (BLR) to combat the rising cost of funds (sector-wide rivalry for retail deposits). As for loans growth, we do not expect a pick-up in pace, considering a challenging macro climate.""Thus, total income is poised to be downbeat and with cost pressure in the offing (from wage inflation and IT spending), should lead to negative Jaws and higher cost-to-income ratio (1QFY19: +1 point (ppt) quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q] to 34%). That said, we see steady asset quality to persist,"" added HLIB.CIMB IB said the drop in 1QFY19 revenue merited a cautious outlook for Public Bank's topline growth in the forecasted financial year of 2019 (FY2019F).""In the coming quarters, we expect banks' revenue to continue to be weighed down by (1) margin contraction arising from the deposit competition, and (2) weak expansion in fee income,"" said CIMB IB.At 11:03am, shares in Public Bank were 0.09% or two sen lower at RM22.54, with 2.12 million shares traded, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM87.89 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/public-banks-1q-results-meet-hlib-expectations-not-cimb-ib,"2019-05-01 20:04:24"

Maintain buy with a target price of RM6.60: CIMB Group Holdings Bhd held a meeting with sell-side analysts ahead of its closed period for release of the first quarter of financial year 2019 (1QFY19) results on May 29. Key takeaways are management reiterated its guidance for loan growth of 7% for 2019. In Malaysia, 1QFY19’s loan growth was good, supported by drawdowns of corporate loans — similar to that in 4QFY18. The management guided for 6% to 7% loan growth for Malaysia. Lending growth in Indonesia is expected at 5% in 2019, on a pickup in the second half (2H) of FY19.CIMB expects the policy rate in Malaysia to remain stable in 2019, maintaining management’s guidance for a five-to-10-basis-point (bps) narrowing of net interest margins (NIM). For 1QFY19, we expect NIM to be stable to slightly better. Aside from a recovery in CIMB Niaga’s 1QFY19 NIM, a slowdown in deposit accumulation in Malaysia has eased pressure on funding costs. The management expects margins to compress in the quarters ahead, as loan growth gathers momentum in 2HFY19.The management is also maintaining its credit cost guidance at 40 to 50bps for FY19, from FY18’s 41 bps. The banking group is not experiencing any pressure across Malaysia and its regional operations. Credit cost is expected to be quite good in 1QFY19, helped by some write-backs and lower provisions at CIMB Niaga. That said, management does not expect sustained recoveries for the quarters ahead. — RHB Research Institute, April 29",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cimbs-loan-growth-expected-gather-momentum-2hfy19,"2019-05-01 20:04:24"

However, she declines to comment on the expected timeline.“It’s still early days, but yes, we’re aiming for a Main Market listing,” she says when contacted by The Edge. It is “difficult to say” whether the listing will happen this year or not, she adds.It is understood that CIMB Investment Bank is working on the IPO.Last December, Bloomberg reported that Rampai-Niaga was targeting to list on Bursa Malaysia as early as the second quarter of this year. The IPO could raise RM200 million, it said, citing unidentified sources.However, because there were no developments on the matter, it gave rise to market talk that the retailer may have abandoned or deferred its plan.Just two weeks ago, QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd — operator of the KFC and Pizza Hut chain of restaurants in Malaysia — announced that it was postponing its Main Market listing.QSR Brands, which reportedly intended to raise RM2 billion from the IPO, said its management and shareholders had decided to “re-time” the exercise following discussions with its bankers.Sources close to the transaction told The Edge Financial Daily that QSR’s IPO was deferred because key potential investors had deemed its valuation too high. The company had initially hoped to price its IPO at a “mid-20s” price-to-earnings (PE) multiple, but cornerstone investors were only willing to get on board for a PE multiple of 15 to 17 times, TEFD reported on April 11.Maybank Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd were the joint principal advisers for that offering.Market observers say given the weak stock market in recent months, investors will be particularly sensitive to the valuation of new offerings. Thus, Rampai-Niaga’s upcoming IPO will be closely watched.The planned IPO comes at a time when the retail industry is sluggish. Malaysia’s retail industry grew 3.9% last year, lagging behind gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the sixth consecutive year, according to Retail Group Malaysia, a retail consulting firm. GDP grew 4.7% last year.Interestingly, however, pharmacy and personal care was the best subsector in the industry, growing 10.2% last year.Nevertheless, Retail Group Malaysia expects an improved growth of 4.5% for the industry. This is within Bank Negara Malaysia’s GDP projection of 4.3% to 4.8% for this year.The Body Shop is a cosmetics, skin care and perfume company based in West Sussex, the UK.Rampai-Niaga is the sole franchisee for the business in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah.Cheah-Foong started her first store in Kuala Lumpur in December 1984, at the now-defunct Plaza Yow Chuan in Ampang. Today, more than 34 years later, she owns 88 stores and faces competition from relatively newer players like L’Occitane and Bath & Body Works.Rampai-Niaga acquired the franchise in Sabah in 2015, according to its website.The company made a net profit of RM28.47 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY2017), which was 14% higher than the year before.This was on the back of revenue of RM153.51 million, which was 7.3% higher than in FY2016.Last year, there were only two Main Market listings on Bursa Malaysia — Mi Equipment Holdings Bhd and Techbond Group Bhd.There has been none so far this year. The first one is expected to be that of Leong Hup International Bhd, the country’s largest poultry player, next month.According to a Nikkei Asean Review report last Thursday, Leong Hup’s IPO is valued at a PE multiple of 15 times.

Malaysia struck a deal with China to resume the East Coast Rail Link at a lower cost and revived the US$34 billion property and transport hub Bandar Malaysia.“Fiscal stimulus, per resurrection of ECRL and Bandar Malaysia projects, is returning, oil prices are exceeding target and liquidity is ample,” the bank said in the report. “Government policy-centric catalytic news flow alone could allow the KLCI to recover to 12-month highs of 1,850.”Macquarie expects similar developments to happen with MRT 3 and the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail project, as well as in the telecom sector and within the Petroliam Nasional Bhd group of companies.The KLCI is showing some signs of a revival. It climbed 1% last week, halting five straight weeks of declines, the longest stretch of losses since 2015.The main risk remains Malaysia’s potential exclusion from FTSE Russell’s World Government Bond Index, which could lead to US$23 billion of government bond outflows as other index providers follow suit and worsen foreign selling in the country’s equities, the bank said.The investment bank prefers “yield-resilient” plays, corporate banks, government-linked companies:",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysias-stock-market-might-turn-corner-soon-macquarie-says,"2019-05-01 20:04:25"

(April 26, RM5.19)
Maintain outperform with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM6.50: CIMB Niaga unsurprisingly kicked off 2019 relatively subdued income-wise, given the recent conclusion of the Indonesian presidential elections which curtailed activity while competitive funding pressures also caused a spike in interest expenses of 11.9% year-on-year (y-o-y), which weighed on net interest income growth (+0.2% y-o-y, +1.3% quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q]). In the first quarter of the financial year 2019 (1QFY19) its net profit increase of 7.6% y-o-y, and 5.9% q-o-q to 944 billion rupiah and continued to benefit from provision decreasing by 16.2% y-o-y and 1.1% q-o-q.Encouragingly, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd is starting to see gradual returns of capital market activity while net interest margins are holding steady. With CIMB Niaga expected to play a significant role in the overall Group’s Forward 23 growth strategy, and the steady operational improvements seen, we are optimistic about longer-term prospects. We retain our outperform call with an unchanged TP of RM6.50.Operating income increases of 1.1% y-o-y, and 3.1% q-o-q are driven predominantly by non-interest income growth of 4% y-o-y, and 8.2% q-o-q. Arranger and syndication fee increases of 241.9% y-o-y, and 488.9% q-o-q are a major contributor, but at a pace which are not expected to be sustainable. However, though likely encouraging going forward.Its net interest margin (NIM) increased 16 basis points (bps) to 5.28% during the quarter, benefitting from a repricing of its asset base following last year’s cumulative 175bps rate hike. Interest income is 4.8% higher y-o-y. Industry-wide deposit competition is causing a noticeable strain to funding costs. However, reflected by the sharp 11.9% y-o-y jump in interest expense. Current account and savings account (Casa) optimisation and digital-based propositions will be major lines of defence against margin erosions. Casa ratio is a healthy 53.74% (4QFY18: 52.61%). Long-term NIMs are targeted to average at approximately 5%.Loans outstanding slipped 0.3% q-o-q, with activity curtailed by the recently concluded presidential and legislative elections as mentioned earlier. Y-o-y growth is an encouraging 5%, with the mortgage (+13.1% y-o-y) and corporate (+6.6% y-o-y) segments as key drivers.With incumbent President Joko Widodo likely to be re-elected, and armed with fresh growth initiatives in tow, infrastructure-related lending may feature more prominently going forward.Continued focus will also be on its consumer and SME franchises, while the group’s auto book is likely to start seeing expansions in 3QFY19 onwards following the successful rebalancing of its portfolio.Asset quality risks are benign, with indicators continuing to show improvements. Gross impaired loan and gross non-performing loan ratios are 3.91% (4QFY18: 4.05%) and 3.04% (4QFY18: 3.11%).An uptick in special mention loans to 4.40% in 1QFY19 (4QFY18: 3.98%) is mostly timing-related. — PublicInvest Research, April 26",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cimb-group-sees-gradual-returns-capital-market-activity,"2019-05-01 20:04:26"

China is not taking home that 1.9 million tonnes of Malaysia palm oil right now, and our stockpile is definitely still too high,” he said.By the same token, any Chinese investment in the construction of new capacities within the local downstream businesses in Malaysia will likely take time, but could help improve domestic demand of the locally-produced palm oil or fresh fruit bunches in the longer run, he said.“The process of funding, setting up and building up until production commences take some time. The demand for upstream products will then be higher as higher downstream activities require more feedstock.“But it is not necessarily just the quantity, as China could also be looking at investing in the diversification of downstream products, which will essentially help to boost demand for palm oil as well,” said Low.At the start of Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s five-day official visit to China last week, two memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were entered into, one of which was aimed at enhancing palm oil trade and China’s investments in the downstream palm oil business.Under the MoU inked by Primary Industries Ministry’s Secretary-General Datuk Dr Tan Yew Chong on behalf of Malaysia, China agrees to buy an additional supply of at least 1.9 million tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia over five years starting 2019.The volume — valued at RM4.56 billion based on an average price of US$600 per tonne — is in addition to the four purchase contracts signed in March for the export of 1.62 million tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia to China, with a combined estimated worth of US$891 million or RM3.64 billion.Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said the additional commitment from China — which already was Malaysia’s second biggest importer of palm oil and palm-based products in 2018 — will be “a big help to smallholders” in Malaysia.The palm oil price has fallen by some RM200 a tonne since its January peak, mostly under the pressure of subdued demand amid elevated stockpiles, which stood at 2.92 million tonnes as at end-March.Last Friday, the benchmark palm oil contract for July delivery closed RM38 lower at RM2,119 a tonne.“Higher overall purchase from China of Malaysian palm oil will help crude palm oil (CPO) prices, but the positive impacts that may result from the agreement depends ultimately on the quantum of the take-up,” CIMB Research regional head of agribusiness Ivy Ng told The Edge Financial Daily when contacted.Ng said if agreed in such a way that China’s take-up of Malaysian palm oil is front loaded in the first half of the five-year period, the development could be positive for CPO prices in the near- to mid-term.“Vice versa, if it is spread out over the five-year period, we see only gradual positive impacts on stocks and therefore prices,” she added.Ng added that China’s involvement in the downstream palm oil activities in Malaysia may help draw down locally-produced stocks in the event it invests in processing capacities that allow for new or additional usage of palm oil, rather than competing with existing palm oil processing capacities in the country.Another area of concern, according to JF Apex’s Low, is whether China’s promise to purchase additional supply of palm oil from Malaysia, being the second-largest palm oil producer, is at the expense of reducing imports of the global commodity from other producing countries.“The agreement is currently still very preliminary. But if that is the case, the total net demand may still be the same, which is why it is important to take a closer look at details of the agreement and monitor it over the years,” he said.An analyst, who declined to be named, said the agreement will make no drastic changes to the current industry dynamics.“I do think that this will instill more positivity and confidence into the plantation sector, but it is not a game-changer,” the analyst said, explaining that the 1.9 million tonnes, if evenly spread over five years, represent a mere 2% of Malaysia’s annual CPO production of about 20 million tonnes. In 2018, Malaysia produced a total of 19.52 million tonnes of CPO across a total oil palm planted area of some 5.85 million hectares.China has been a key buyer of Malaysian palm oil, although Malaysia’s annual palm oil export volume to the country shrank to below three million tonnes after 2015, overtaken by Indonesia.As of last year, Malaysia exported 3.07 million tonnes of palm oil and palm products valued at RM8.38 billion to China — up 7.3% from the 2.86 million tonnes valued at up to RM9.39 billion in 2017.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/no-immediate-impact-seen-chinas-cpo-buy-pledge,"2019-05-01 20:04:27"

160,"April 25, 2019 10:18 am +08",CIMB,"Malaysia ends deflation streak in March","KUALA LUMPUR: Deflation worries eased yesterday after Malaysia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) staged a rebound, rising 0.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) in March from a year ago.Despite ending a two-month streak of negative inflation, the rebound came in below the consensus median forecast of 0.3%, and analysts believe the central bank may start easing its monetary policy as early as next month.Yesterday, the Department of Statistics Malaysia said in a statement the increase in the overall index in March was driven by housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (+2%), education (+1.3%), food and non-alcoholic beverages (+1.1%) and restaurant and hotels (+1%).“On a monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.2% compared with February. It was mainly supported by the indices of transport (+2.6%), miscellaneous goods and services (+0.4%) and furnishing, household equipment and routine household maintenance (+0.3%),” said its chief statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin.This brings Malaysia’s CPI in the first quarter of 2019 (1Q19) to 120.8, a 0.3% decline from 121.2 in the same quarter of the preceding year. The decline was contributed by transport (-5.9%), clothing and footwear (-3.1%), miscellaneous goods and services (-2.2%) and communication (-1.2%).On a quarterly basis, the CPI decreased 0.1% compared with 4Q18.Commenting on March data, UOB Research senior economist Julia Goh and economist Loke Siew Ting said given the muted headline inflation and below potential growth, the central bank can afford to lower rates marginally, reversing the 25 basis-point (bps) hike in January 2018.The research firm is projecting full-year inflation to remain subdued at 1.5%, compared with 1% of 2018, despite expectations for headline inflation to trend higher in the second half of 2019.“Some market players are rethinking the possibility of an overnight policy rate (OPR) cut amid ringgit pressure. However, we are still pencilling in a possible 25bps cut to 3% at the upcoming monetary policy meeting on May 7.“The ringgit is unlikely to weaken significantly if rates are lowered by reasonable magnitudes, and is seen to support growth. It would also help to lower borrowing costs and expedite funding for fiscal spending amid the revival of projects such as East Coast Rail Link and Bandar Malaysia,” said Goh.Economists at CIMB, Michelle Chia and Lim Yee Ping, also see an OPR cut on the cards, but said its timing may be complicated by the FTSE Russell review due in 3Q19.“While we initially viewed May as a possible window for action, Bank Negara Malaysia may be inclined to exercise caution following Malaysia’s inclusion in FTSE Russell’s watch list, ahead of an annual review in September, and the dampened sentiment in Malaysia’s government bond market, as investors weigh the risks of significant capital outflows if the country was removed from the FTSE Russell World Government Bond Index.”For AllianceDBS Research chief economist Manokaran Mottain, the 0.3% y-o-y contraction in the CPI’s three-month moving average — matching a similar level in the preceding month — signals that prices may have likely bottomed out and possibly set to normalise in the upcoming months.“All in all, accounting for the unexpected deflationary period and fixing of pump prices (RON95 and diesel) in end-February, coupled with expectations of normalising inflationary pressures in the second half of 2019, we maintain our 2019 inflation forecast at between 1% and 1.5% y-o-y. We also reiterate our 2019 gross domestic product growth forecast of 4.5% (2018: +4.7%),” he said.MIDF Research, meanwhile, has revised its inflation forecast to 1.1% for 2019, from the earlier forecast of 2.2% due to lower cap of domestic RON95 fuel price at RM2.08.“Furthermore, we believe the government is unlikely to remove the cap in the nearest time as the proper subsidy mechanism limiting it to the recipients of the Bantuan Sara Hidup has yet to come into effect. We anticipate inflationary pressure mainly from fuel-related items to remain weak despite higher expectation of Brent crude oil price at US$75 (RM309.75) per barrel for 2019 (2018: US$72 per barrel),” it added.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysia-ends-deflation-streak-march,"2019-05-01 20:04:33"

Both Ihsan Perdana and Gandingan Mentari were former SRC International’s subsidiaries.The RM50 million came from SRC International, defence lawyer Harvinderjit Singh later confirmed.On the RM8 million difference, High Court judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali allowed an application by Harvinderjit for Rosaiah to help produce an image of the cheque issued by Ihsan Perdana in December 2014 of the same value, in order to trail its recipient.“It forms part of our defence that there are people in SRC who are doing questionable business ... it shows that it is part of the same transactions,” said Harvinderjit on the rationale for the application. Nik Faisal authorised signatory for SRC, Gandingan Mentari, Najib accountsThe last witness of the day was AmBank Jalan Raja Chulan branch manager R Uma Devi. The 40-year-old elaborated on the numerous details of the AmBank accounts for SRC, Gandingan Mentari and Najib.Among others, Uma Devi said SRC International received RM4 billion through multiple transactions in 2011 and 2012 — likely related to the RM4 billion loan obtained from Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) which Najib was accused of facilitating using his power as prime minister at the time.The court was told that SRC International chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil and ex-SRC International director Datuk Suboh Md Yassin were the signatories of the dubious transactions of RM50 million from SRC International to Gandingan Mentari and later to Ihsan Perdana in 2014 and 2015.For SRC International, the signatories were divided into two groups, with Suboh in one and Nik Faisal in another. Gandingan Mentari only had the duo as the signatories, explained Uma Devi.Nik Faisal was also appointed by the former prime minister as the “authorised personnel” to manage his three bank accounts in AmBank, she added.“I refer to a letter by Datuk Seri Najib Razak which appointed Nik Faisal as the authorised personnel for all three new accounts in AmBank,” she told the High Court during the witness examination-in-chief by deputy public prosecutor Datuk Suhaimi Ibrahim.Including the above, Uma Devi highlighted multiple transactions into Najib’s three AmBank accounts, where most transactions were made under instruction received through Nik Faisal’s letters.These included payment of RM3.82 million for two credit cards in August 2014, as well as a RM27 million payment to Permai Bina Raya Sdn Bhd in July 2014 — the latter of which may be linked to another money laundering charge faced by Najib in a separate case in February.Nik Faisal is currently missing, with a news report in June last year saying he had been travelling to and from Indonesia since the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal broke out in 2015. Arrest warrants have been issued for the 48-year-old, alongside missing businessman Low Taek Jho, the central figure in the billion-dollar scandal involving the 1MDB group of companies.For Suboh, it was reported in June last year that the former SRC International director had surrendered to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission. According to news reports in February, Suboh had been placed under witness protection programme pending this currently ongoing trial.Najib faces seven charges in relation to RM42 million allegedly siphoned from SRC International.The trial resumes at 9am today.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/rm25m-najib-went-habibul-through-law-firm-court-told,"2019-05-01 20:04:33"

Analysts attributed the rising uptrend and interest to a more concerted government push to boost the economy as well as abating external concerns over the US-China trade tensions.The FBM KLCI gained 10.6 points or 0.6% yesterday to 1,638 points for its second straight day of gains. The benchmark index has risen by almost 1% this week and market players are hopeful it can be sustained until the first quarter corporate reporting season.“There has been interest in the market over the past few days particularly in the beaten down stocks, especially banks and healthcare, as well as Tenaga Nasional Bhd,” MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman told The Edge Financial Daily over the phone.Mohd Redza said the rebound comes amid receding concerns about a potential cut to the overnight policy rate, which would have hurt bank earnings and dragged the index down as banking stocks account for the largest weightage on the FBM KLCI.He said of the 16 points increase so far this week, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and Public Bank Bhd, have collectively contributed six points.In addition, domestic macroeconomic figures are still showing “great” numbers, he said, pointing in particular to the consumer price index (CPI) which had been in the negative zone for two consecutive months, sparking concerns of a deflation. However, the CPI registered a marginal growth of 0.2% year-on-year in March.Mohd Redza said the CPI had finally breached the positive line, “as expected.”“But we had to halve the full year (CPI) forecast to 1.1%, since RON95 fuel is now stagnant at RM2.08 per litre,” he said.Hong Leong Investment Bank head of retail research Loui Low expects the KLCI rebound to be sustainable as news flow turns positive, coupled with higher crude oil prices.“Basically, we think the technical rebound should be sustainable because there is less negative news out there compared to the positive ones,” he said, pointing to the recent revival of the East Coast Rail Link and Bandar Malaysia mega infrastructure projects following a government review.“That bodes well for the construction related counters in terms of the trading activities at least for the near term. Also, the firmer crude oil prices are lifting sentiment too as well as [providing] more positive bias indicators at this juncture,” he said.What’s even more interesting, he pointed out, is the strength of trading volume which rocketed to 4.7 billion shares on Monday, 3.7 billion shares on Tuesday and 4.4 billion shares yesterday — well above the 2.7 billion average year-to-date until last Friday.“Value traded the last three trading days also went up to an average RM2.8 billion daily from RM2 billion daily between Jan 1 and April 19,” he noted.While Mohd Redza does not expect the increased trading volume to be sustainable, he expects the momentum to be sustained until next month when first quarter corporate earnings are announced.“We don’t expect corporate earnings to be spectacular because we had seen weakness in export numbers, (plus) long festive holidays and shutdowns, which have impacted distributive sales numbers during the quarter,” he said.As a result, GDP is projected to be lower, albeit still above 4%.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/trading-volume-market-improves,"2019-05-01 20:04:34"

He did not tell me where the payment is from,"" said Ashraf, the 18th prosecution witness, while he was examined by deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Saifuddin Hashim Musaimi.The witness said he was a partner at Zulqarnain & Co from 1996 to 2017, and has been working with Habibul for 12 years.Habibul is a shareholder in Fuelsubs House Sdn Bhd, which tendered to manage the fuel subsidy.""Habibul informed that there is a payment, and he requested me to receive the payment for the defence contract as part of payment from him to me.""There is a small acknowledgement letter between himself and myself on the payment through the cheque, which was signed by him [Habibul],"" the witness said.Ashraf said he deposited the cheque the next working day.The witness said when he worked with Habibul, the corporate figure wanted the matter to proceed smoothly and quickly, and that he awaited his client's instruction on the payment to be made, which included his lawyer fees.Saifuddin: How much was the fee?Ashraf: RM50,000, sir.Habibul, the witness said, then instructed Ashraf to issue cheques to, among others, Habibul's wife and his kids.""And in stages after that, he told me to issue cheques to parties he determined, as well as cash cheques,"" Ashraf added.Saifuddin: Do you know why he did not issue the cheque into his own account and told you to manage this [fund]?Ashraf: Sorry I do not know.Saifuddin: You managed the whole RM2.5 million?Ashraf: Yes sir.The lawyer said he did not ask where the money for the cheque came from nor the legitimacy of the money, as he had known Habibul for a long time, and also due to his position as a corporate leader.The 18th witness added that to hasten the overall payment process, some of the money was transferred into his personal account, where he distributed the funds via telegraphic transfer to the accounts of Habibul and his aide, known only as Azmi.When cross-examined by Najib's co-counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, Ashraf admitted to being called by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and had his statement recorded regarding the cheque.Ashraf admitted in court that he is a friend of Habibul, and still keeps in contact with him.The witness added that he had received funds from Habibul about 10 times between 2013 and 2015, but the amounts were much less than the cheque his former firm had received from Najib.Besides the lawyer, two other bankers namely CIMB's Edward Innasi and Affin Bank's Rosaiah Mohamed Rosli also testified today.Innasi testified about the RM2.5 million cheque which had been cashed while Rosaiah told the court that Ihsan Perdana Sdn Bhd, which holds an account in Affin Bank, received RM50 million on Dec 24, 2014 and Feb 6, 2015.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/najibsrc-trial-lawyer-received-rm25m-cheque-corporate-figure-habibul-rahman,"2019-05-01 20:04:34"

At the time of writing, the ringgit was at 4.1365 against the greenback.While trading sentiment was weighed down for almost the whole of last week by fears that Malaysian government bonds could be removed from FTSE Russell’s index, Zafrul said Malaysia’s performance on the bond index is still positive year to date.“I’m quite confident that we will still be included [in the index]. We believe that now with the level of engagement with the government, Bank Negara Malaysia and all the players. I’m sure that they will agree that we will still be in the index,” he added.In the worst case, Zafrul said there are still a lot of benchmark indices that investors can use.“But the benchmark must be accurate... and for Malaysia, if [it was] to be excluded [from the FTSE Russell index], would not be a true benchmark, given that Malaysia is quite a big player in the bond market,” said Zafrul.“We’ve seen the worst already,” said Zafrul, adding that investors will continue to be cautious, and will take a wait-and-see approach prior to FTSE Russell’s decision.Meanwhile, on the bank’s operational side, Zafrul said CIMB is allotting RM900 million in capital expenditure for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 (FY19), to be used to enhance its information technology (IT) and operations.In comparison, the bank spent some RM500 million last year on a business-as-usual (BAU) basis.“Basically, under our Forward23 programme we have incremental expenditure of 4% which translates into about RM400 million increase in costs related to IT,” said Zafrul.“This would be on top of the RM500 million we would spend BAU. So effectively over 60% increase for this year,” he added.Zafrul told reporters after the group’s annual general meeting here yesterday that this is the reason that the bank is expecting to expand its return on equity for Forward23 to 12% by 2023.Nearly four months in the year, Zafrul noted that the bank is still maintaining its loan growth target of 6% to 7% in Malaysia.“We are quite cautiously optimistic that we will achieve the target given the performance that we have seen in the first quarter,” said Zafrul, adding that the bank is dependent on the performance of Malaysia’s general economy which is still expected to grow at 4.5%.Additionally, Zafrul said the bank will be planning for at least three initial public offerings (IPOs) by the end of this year, versus none in 2018.Declining to disclose further details, he only noted that the IPOs are within the consumer and infrastructure sectors.CIMB shares were up 10 sen or 1.97% to close at RM5.17 yesterday, bringing its market capitalisation to RM49.45 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cimb-sees-no-opr-cut-shrugs-ftse-russell-delisting-fears,"2019-05-01 20:04:37"

It was Bursa’s most actively traded counter of the day, with 282.03 million shares done.  Its share price has more than doubled year to date.Also active in line with the Bandar Malaysia theme was Iskandar Waterfront City Bhd (IWCity), which is also controlled by Lim and a subsidiary of IWH. Shares in the developer rose 30 sen or 29.41% to RM1.32, having tripled since the start of the year.Other notable gainers were Gadang Holdings Bhd, which rose 23 sen or 32.17%, and Fajarbaru Builder Group Bhd, which climbed 11 sen or 27.16% (see table). Out of 49 stocks on the Kuala Lumpur Construction Index, 40 closed higher yesterday, while only two ended the day in the red.Other big names in the construction sector that closed higher include Gamuda Bhd (up 27 sen or 8.77% to RM3.35), IJM Corp Bhd (up nine sen or 4.09% to RM2.29) and Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (up 10 sen or 10.42% to RM1.06).According to Rakuten Trade head of research Kenny Yee, the rally in construction stocks is not just because of the revival of Bandar Malaysia. “Bandar Malaysia does play a part but most importantly, it is the positive newsflow on projects of late that has propped up the construction sector,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.Although the ECRL is now going to be cheaper by 32.8% or RM21.5 billion, the project’s main contractor China Communications Construction Co Ltd has agreed — under the new supplementary agreement signed with Putrajaya on April 12 — to ensure 40% of the civil works are awarded to local contractors.While the twin revivals of the ECRL and Bandar Malaysia have given a shot in the arm to construction stocks, they do not seem to have generated strong buying interest among constituents of the benchmark FBM KLCI, which closed flattish yesterday.Nevertheless, they appear to have acted as a catalyst for the wider market, as market breadth was positive across Bursa Malaysia yesterday, with 544 gainers outpacing 326 decliners. Trading volume swelled to 4.77 billion shares, with a significant RM3.18 billion value of shares crossed.Interestingly, PLS Plantations Bhd, another company which Lim controls, also climbed. The loss-making oil palm planter, which is diversifying into the durian plantation business, jumped 28 sen or 29.23% yesterday to close at RM1.26.Other gainers included building materials players like cement maker Lafarge Malaysia Bhd, which gained 13.3% to close at RM2.64. The stock saw only tepid interest last week despite news of the ECRL’s continuation, as analysts opined that the railway alone would add only a small boost to demand for its products. Meanwhile, steelmakers like Ann Joo Resources Bhd, Mycron Steel Bhd, Malaysia Steel Works (KL) Bhd and Southern Steel Bhd also gained.According to AmInvestment Bank’s research team yesterday, demand for building materials will depend on how aggressively Bandar Malaysia rolls out its launches.“We are more inclined to want to look beyond the sectors in our analysis for the revival of Bandar Malaysia. We believe investors should instead focus on how the improved Malaysia-China ties could help bring down the market risk premium, resulting in multiple expansion for the market,” it said in a note.“We are mindful that not many local contractors have worked with Chinese main contractors before, and if their experience in time will be a fruitful one,” AmInvestment Bank said.As to whether the rejuvenation of the mega infrastructure project signals a potential comeback of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), where the last agreed alignment included a stop at Bandar Malaysia, views were mixed.While AllianceDBS is positive on the HSR’s resuscitation, CIMB Research does not think Bandar Malaysia’s reinstatement suggests a similar fate for the HSR, which is still pending a review, with a decision due on May 2020.“While the return of Bandar Malaysia is a positive surprise in terms of potentially catalysing new construction works, potential beneficiaries are likely limited to smaller/medium-sized building contractors for which tenders could be competitive,” CIMB Research added in a note yesterday.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bandar-malaysia-ecrl-revivals-boost-construction-stocks-wider-market,"2019-05-01 20:04:38"
171,"April 22, 2019 15:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Solutions: Matching individuals with the right financial products and services","In Malaysia, applying for a loan or credit card is not a complicated process. Many are not concerned when their applications are rejected a lender as they believe they can easily apply again elsewhere. However, this may not be a good idea as the inquiries made the lender when processing the application could negatively affect their credit scores.Rian Philip, founder and CEO of MoFintech Sdn Bhd, says the impact can be significant, especially if they are making several applications at once. “The problem is that there are many things people do not understand about their credit scores and how their actions could affect them.“For example, a person who thinks he barely qualifies for a certain credit card may apply at five different lenders to increase his chances. Little does he know that his credit score has already declined, whether the applications are approved or not.“Applications give lenders permission to pull their credit scores. These inquiries affect one’s credit score, especially if the applications are subsequently rejected.”To help Malaysians maintain a good credit score while efficiently applying for credit facilities, Philip has introduced Mobylize — a mobile app that allows individuals to access their credit scores in real time and thereafter match them with the right financial products and services for which they have a higher chance of obtaining approval. downloading the app, users are able to access their credit scores and brief information on their credit history for free, provided Credit Bureau Malaysia (CBM).“We are the first app in Malaysia to give users real-time scores. There is a credit reporting agency that does it through an app, but users have to wait about 30 minutes for verification to take place. We can do it in real time because we have a secure server-to-server connection with CBM,” says Philip.After obtaining their free credit score, users are presented with personal loan products and credit cards that would be suitable for them based on their score. They can make an in-app application for these facilities. Since the app already has the user’s basic credit information, the user does not need to fill in a lot of forms.“When users apply for credit facilities via the app, we send them a link to a pre-filled application form for them to verify. Once the users approve the form, we will send it over to the banks to process,” says Philip.“Currently, banks still need to call users if they need any additional information or to inform them of the status of their application. However, we will roll out an update in the middle of this year that will allow all stakeholders to engage only on the app. So, there will be no need for users to do anything outside the app.”He plans to make this process more seamless also allowing users to apply for home and business loans directly via the app.From time to time, users of the app will be asked lifestyle-related questions to help the algorithm understand the user’s lifestyle factors that go beyond a credit report. This includes questions on their income, saving habits and spending patterns. With the information, the app will be able to provide more customised tips and personalised recommendations to users, says Philip.“We are continually engaging with users, drilling deep to check their eligibility. So, their chances of getting approval for a recommended product is slightly higher. Of course, the party making the final decision is still the lender. But we are trying to make the back-end process smoother and more efficient.”The list of banks that offer products on Mobylize include Al-Rajhi Bank, Bank Muamalat, RHB Bank, and CIMB Bank. Philip and his team are working to expand this list and provide users with more product choices.Mobylize is currently experimenting with several features, including facial recognition for the onboarding process. It is also translating the app into Bahasa Malaysia to be more inclusive.“I have noticed that all the credit reports are in English. I think it will benefit a lot of Malaysians if we provide them with information in a language they understand better,” says Philip. Helping Malaysians to be credit positivePhilip is focusing on getting Malaysians to understand their credit scores and how these affect them. He says that based on a 2016 survey CTOS Data Systems Sdn Bhd and iMoney, it is alarming to know that 67% of Malaysians have never seen their credit reports. Also, according to several news reports last year, about 47% of young Malaysians were in very bad credit debt and more than 60,000 Malaysians aged between 18 and 44 had been declared bankrupt in the last five years.Mobylize will run a “Get Credit Positive” campaign with CBM next month to educate Malaysians on how they can improve their credit scores, says Philip, who does not want to stop at feeding users just content-based information. He wants to recommend appropriate actions they can take to develop better credit scores.“Let’s say they have a few credit cards. There is such a thing as credit utilisation ratio. It is not good for them to max out one card and use only 10% of the other cards. Via the app, we will probably suggest a credit card that gives them 0% transfer balance with a higher credit limit,” says Philip.“If their credit card has a credit limit of RM10,000 and they have used RM9,000, they have 90% exposure from the credit card. If they get another credit card that has a credit limit of RM20,000, they can reduce their exposure from the first card to only 40% when they transfer some of the balance [to this card]. This will improve their credit score.”During the campaign, the app will also recommend that users terminate credit cards they never use, he adds. For thin-file users or those without enough credit history to generate a credit score, the app will suggest ways for them to start building their credit history and inform them why it is necessary.The app currently generates revenue from bank referral fees when users apply for credit facilities through Mobylize, says Philip. He adds that he has no intention of charging users for the credit information provided on the app. He thinks this is important as it brings a lot of value to the users if he takes away this barrier to understanding their credit scores better.“Users had to answer security questions based on their credit report when registering for the app. Recently, a user told us he was asked whether he had an overdraft facility. He answered no, but he was wrong. His bank had actually converted its credit card annual fee to overdraft and he had no idea about this.

The 93-year-old met the two top Chinese leaders in August last year, to reset and recalibrate their bilateral relationship under the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government, which came to power last May.This time, Mahathir is scheduled to attend the second edition of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation at the invitation of Xi, and is slated to deliver a speech at the event on April 26.Several memoranda of understanding, including on palm oil, are expected to be signed on the sidelines of the event.On Monday, focus will resume on former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s SRC International Sdn Bhd graft trial. Najib faces criminal breach of trust and abuse of power charges in relation to the RM42 million from SRC that was deposited into his accounts.The trial last week saw testimony from Bank Negara Malaysia manager Azizul Adzani Abdul Ghafar, who took part in the raid at AmBank Raja Chulan in Kuala Lumpur. Azizul is the prosecution’s second witness. Another Bank Negara officer, Mohammad Nizam Yahya, also testified.The Edge will be covering the trial involving the former highest-ranking politician in Malaysia who led the country for nine years, with updates on theedgemarkets.com.Also on Monday, Bank Negara is set to release its international reserves data for mid-April.

The CPI, which measures inflation, declined 0.4% year on year in February, led by the drop in transport costs. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg are expecting March’s inflation growth to come in at 0.3% y-o-y.Elsewhere, neighbouring Singapore is set to release its March CPI data on Tuesday. The city state’s CPI grew 0.5% in February while core inflation, which excludes the changes in the price of cars and accommodation, was at a nine-month low of 1.5%. Singapore will also be releasing its March industrial production numbers on Friday. Its manufacturing output in February rose 0.7% from a year earlier.Indonesia, which just saw the conclusion of its 2019 elections with Indonesian President Joko Widodo declaring victory, will see a key monetary policy decision by its central bank on Thursday.

So, effectively it is over 60% increase for this year,"" he added.Zafrul told reporters that this is the reason the bank is expecting a flat return-on-equity (ROE) of 12% for FY19.Nearly four months into the year, Zafrul noted that the bank is still maintaining its loan growth target of 6% to 7% in Malaysia.""We are quite cautiously optimistic that we will achieve the target given the performance that we have seen in the first quarter,"" said Zafrul, adding that the bank is dependent on the performance of the general economy of Malaysia, which is still expected to grow at 4.5%.Other key targets for FY19 is cost-to-income ratio at about 45%, and common equity tier 1 (CET1) at 13%.Additionally, Zafrul said the bank will be planning for at least three initial public offerings (IPOs) by the end of this year, versus none in 2018.At the midday break, shares of CIMB were up 10 sen or 1.97% at RM5.17, bringing its market capitalisation to RM49.64 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cimb-group-allocates-rm900m-capex-fy19,"2019-05-01 20:04:40"

Moreover, the emphasis of local content in the construction process would further stimulate local construction activities,” it said. HLIB Research said Iskandar Waterfront City Bhd (IWCity), Ekovest Bhd and Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) are the counters that stand to be major beneficiaries once Bandar Malaysia was materialised. To recap, the government had announced the Bandar Malaysia project was reinstated last Friday. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said IWH-CREC Sdn Bhd had been chosen to take up the 60% stake in Bandar Malaysia via an open tender exercise that drew participation from over 40 world-renowned companies, including from Japan, Australia and the Middle East.IWH-CREC is a 60:40 joint venture (JV) between Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Sdn Bhd (IWH) and state-owned China Railway Engineering Corp (M) Sdn Bhd (CREC). Businessman Tan Sri Lim Kang Hoo holds a 63% stake in IWH, while Kumpulan Prasarana Rakyat Johor Sdn Bhd owns the remaining 37%.Meanwhile, IWH owns a 37.72% stake in public-listed firm IWCity. Both Ekovest and IWCity have a common major shareholder in property tycoon Lim.Following the revival of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), Bandar Malaysia and potentially high-speed rail (HSR) projects, it appears the worst is over for Malaysia's construction industry, according to HLIB Research.Thanks to the positive news flow, construction counters have been largely reflected by the run in contractor’s share price year-to-date (ytd), with the KLCON up 31%.As such, HLIB Research maintained neutral on construction, and its top stock pick for the sector is Kimlun Corp Bhd.Separately, CIMB Research is maintaining an underweight rating for the construction sector on government’s decision to restore the Bandar Malaysia project, which was abruptly terminated in May 2017.  “Similar to the ECRL, the Bandar Malaysia project is to be viewed within the larger context of fostering and cementing longer-term bilateral relations between Malaysia and China under the overall Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),” said the research house.Of the total 483 acres, CIMB Research said phase one could take up 100-150 acres of land (20-30% of total and size) over five to ten years.“Assuming a general guideline of 10-15% gross development cost (GDC) on the earlier estimated RM50 billion-60 billion GDV, we roughly estimate that potential value of construction works could range from RM5 billion to RM9 billion,” it said.“While the return of Bandar Malaysia is a positive surprise in terms of potentially catalysing new construction works and as the number of affordable housing units in the project is doubled from 5,000 to 10,000, potential beneficiaries are likely limited to smaller/medium-sized building contractors for which tenders could be competitive,” it added.CIMB Research noted the construction of 10,000 affordable homes and prioritising local content in the construction phase will enhance job flows but over a period of time.“Within our coverage, IJM Corp Bhd, Sunway Bhd (via Sunway Construction Bhd) and WCT Holdings Bhd are potential beneficiaries of the affordable housing scopes, although we believe they will be highly selective in their bids.""New construction works in Bandar Malaysia will also benefit building material players over the longer run,” it added.Nonetheless, CIMB Research said the reinstatement of the Bandar Malaysia deal does not suggest a revival of the KL-Singapore HSR (and the earlier planned terminus in Bandar Malaysia) as the latter is pending a review, with a decision due in May 2020.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bandar-malaysia-resuscitation-positive-local-construction-sector,"2019-05-01 20:04:40"

(April 19, RM5.07)
Upgrade to outperform with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM6.10. CIMB Thai Bank Pcl’s three months of financial year 2019 (3MFY19) earnings exceeded our expectations accounting for 41% of our full-year estimates, attributed to lower-than-expected impairment allowances. Asset quality improved in tandem with the lower impairments. We made no revision to CIMB Group’s earnings pending the release of its results next month as generally CIMB Thai’s contribution is minimal. We upgrade our call for the group as valuations are undemanding. 
Year-on-year (y-o-y), 3MFY19 core net profit (CNP) of 325 million baht (RM42.2 million) improved 92% mainly attributed to falling impairment allowances (-17%) to 971 million baht and gains on sale of non-performing loans (NPL) of 169 million baht. Top line declined by 2%, dragged by falling fee-based income (-26%) to 507 million baht despite a +4% uptick in fund-based income to 2.71 billion baht. Fund-based income improvement was supported by higher loans (+16%) despite net interest margin (NIM) shedding 105 basis points (bps) to 3.8% due to higher funding costs. Operating expenditure saw an uptick of six percentage points, in line with the bank’s transitional expenses. Asset quality improved as gross impaired loans (GIL) fell 90bps to 4.3% with credit costs falling 51bps to 1.7% (versus estimate of more than 2% due to higher provisioning in preparation of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 9.Quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), CNP of 325 million baht rebounded from negative territory, due to falling impairment allowances (-39%) and gains from NPL sales. Top line fell (-3%) to 3.21 billion baht as both fund-based and fee-based incomes fell 3% and 1%, respectively. The weak fund-based income was dragged by falling NIMs (54bps) to 3.8% with slower loans (+2%), for the third consecutive period despite the accommodative interest rates. Asset quality continued to be stable with GIL stable at 4.3% and credit charge falling 120bps to 1.7%. The higher base of 2.9% before was due to provisioning in preparation of FRS9 in 2020.Maintain higher credit charge for earnings for financial year 2019 (FY19E). We maintain our view of uptick in credit charge due to the new guidelines from the Bank of Thailand (BOT) (FRS9 provisioning). Double-digit loan growth was a surprise but was due to a lower base as the first quarter (1Q) is generally a weak quarter. Loans will likely moderate (from small and medium enterprises [SMEs] and corporates); but expected to be driven by consumer demand (as interest rates are still accommodative despite the 25bps hike to 1.75% in December 2018). We also expect downside pressure on NIM due to competitive lending ahead. We maintain our view of improved FY19 earnings ahead at 790 million baht based on these assumptions: (i) loan growth of less than (<) 6%, (ii) NIM <4%, (iii) credit costs at 230bps, (iv) CIR at 57%, and (v) tax rate at <22%.There is no change to our forecasts for the group, as historically CIMB Thai’s contribution to the group is minimal (<7%). FY18 pre-profit contribution was at 6%.The group’s 3MFY19 results are expected at the end of the month, thus FY19E earnings of RM4.7 billion are maintained for now, based on the following assumptions: (i) loan growth of approximately -5.5% (ii) NIM compression at 10bps and (iii) credit charge of 45bps.Our TP of RM6.10 is based on a target price-to-book value of one time, implying a 0.5 standard deviation level below its five-year mean to reflect the ongoing challenges and volatility ahead. As valuations are undemanding with potential total returns more than 10%, we upgrade the group to “outperform”.Downside risks to our call are: (i) higher-than-expected margin squeeze, (ii) lower-than-expected loan and deposit growth, (iii) worse-than-expected deterioration in asset quality, (iv) further slowdown in capital market activities, and (v) adverse currency fluctuations. — Kenanga Research, April 19",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/improved-fy19-earnings-seen-cimb-thai-bank,"2019-05-01 20:04:42"

For example, BNM and all Malaysian local and foreign banks have done tremendous work on the Appointed Overseas Office and dynamic hedging framework to facilitate genuine hedging trades with ease,” he said.Financial Markets Association Malaysia president Datuk Lee Kok Kwan also pointed out that the Malaysian bond market is deep enough to accommodate reduction of foreign holdings in the government debt papers.“No, the situation is not concerning as the Malaysian bond market is deep and well developed with more than RM1.5 trillion in outstanding issuances, where the market was just giving up some of the gains after the significant rally in February earlier this year,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.Lee sees the oversubscription of the new issuance indicating demand for government debt papers remains strong.“Non-resident holdings have been stable at around 23% as at end March and while non-resident holdings might increase or decline periodically, the domestic take-up is very strong, which has been amply demonstrated over and over again through many periodic market episodes and economic cycles.“It is the foreign exchange that is more volatile but the fundamentals of the economy [are] relatively solid as the current account is in surplus, where the government has very little foreign currency debt, GDP (gross domestic product) growth is decent at above 4.5% and the fiscal deficit is manageable and it is fully funded in ringgit with no dependency on foreign currency funding,” he added.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mgs-yield-climbs-further-while-ringgit-softens,"2019-05-01 20:04:46"

If chosen, Genting expects to borrow in yen to fund its venture in Japan, chief operating officer Tan Hee Teck was quoted as saying to shareholders, given ""really, really low"" interest rates in Japan.Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd has inked an agreement with MEASAT Communication Systems Sdn Bhd (MCSSB) for the utilisation of transponder capacity on the MEASAT-3d (M3d) satellite for US$360 million (RM1.49 billion).Under the M3d agreement, MCSSB will supply Astro’s unit MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems Sdn Bhd (MBNS) with the transponder capacity of 12 transponders on the M3d satellite for 15 years from the commencement date.Concurrently, MBNS had agreed on the early termination of the April 12, 2018 agreement to use the transponder capacity on the MEASAT-3b satellite.Sime Darby Property Bhd is changing the way it builds its properties by using a new online platform called dto, in which it has invested RM3 million, that allows potential customers to jointly create its products.British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd (BAT) is eager to launch its heat-not-burn products in Malaysia, but the plan has been held back due to the lack of approval from the Government.Its competitor, Philip Morris International (PMI), launched its heat-not-burn product, IQOS, in Malaysia late last year.On another note, BAT said it will consider expanding its cigarette manufacturing in the country again, three years after shutting down its iconic factory in Petaling Jaya.""We made a conscious decision to open the little plant in Johor Bahru because we want to maintain our Malaysian manufacturing licence,"" said BAT managing director Erik Stoel. The Johor Bahru plant, with a capacity to produce some 150 million sticks, opened in October 2018.Widad Group Bhd, formerly known as Ideal Jacobs (M) Corp Bhd, has bagged an RM190.5 million contract to build a 200-bed multi-disciplinary private hospital based in Selangor from its parent company Widad Business Group Sdn Bhd.Bintai Kinden Corp Bhd’s plan to jointly develop a Melaka project, with an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM350 million, has been dropped following the lapse of a preliminary agreement. It said the Memorandum of Understanding’s expiry will not have any financial impact on the group or its subsidiaries.Its unit Kejuruteraan Bintai Kindenko Sdn Bhd (KBK) with Vista Springs Development Sdn Bhd signed the MoU in October 2017 to develop the project, located on a 4.74-acre (1.98ha) piece of freehold land in Melaka. The MoU was extended twice, each by six months, thereafter.Seacera Group Bhd warns that the company’s financial constraints may potentially lead to it defaulting on loan repayments as the proposed fund-raising exercises, which involves recapitalisation and private placement, are unable to be completed on time.Such an alarming statement came after the company’s single largest shareholder, Datuk Tan Wei Lian, who holds a 16% stake, insisted that the EGM had taken place and the majority of the shareholders present had voted against the proposed capitalisation and share placement.The EGM was convened on Tuesday. However, the company’s chairman Datuk Seri Mansor Masikon adjourned the EGM.JAKS Resources Bhd is now planning to place out up to 10% of its shares to third-party investors to raise up to RM54.97 million, four months after the group completed a rights issue with warrants that failed to raise sufficient funds required for its Vietnam power plant project.The undersubscribed rights issue, which was completed in December last year with a take-up rate of only 37.52%, just managed to bring in gross proceeds of RM25.61 million, in contrast to the RM68.24 million it had intended to raise to expedite the project.UEM Sunrise Bhd has been served a notice of arbitration by Ireka Corp Bhd’s unit, seeking a declaration sum of RM29.25 million in relation to disputes and differences arising from a contract finalisation.According to Ireka, the claims made were premised on the breach of contract and outstanding payment due in relation to the contract.In June 2012, Ireka Engineering and Construction Sdn Bhd (IECSB) was appointed by UEM Sunrise’ unit UEM Land as the main contractor for the construction of proposed mixed development Imperia located in Puteri Harbour, Iskandar Puteri, Johor, at a contract sum of RM268.6 million.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cimb-genting-astro-sime-darby-prop-bat-widad-bintai-kinden-seacera-jaks-uem-sunrise-and,"2019-05-01 20:04:46"

186,"April 18, 2019 15:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Cover Story: Growing IHH","TOWARDS the end of July 2012, at a meeting with bankers and fund managers in the run-up to IHH Healthcare Bhd’s initial public offering, an executive of a financial institution asked what was so special about the healthcare provider.“If we throw a few billion dollars, we can recreate IHH,” he said.In response, IHH’s current managing director and CEO, Dr Tan See Leng, explained that the hardware — the hospitals and equipment — could be acquired but the people — the specialists, doctors and other employees — could not be replicated.“Where do you get the people?” he asks in an exclusive interview with The Edge late last month, while talking about the barriers to entry into the healthcare sector.“Merrill (Lynch) was there, Credit Suisse was there, Goldman Sachs, CIMB, DBS, all our backers, (legal firm) Allen & Gledhill, all in, about 100 of them were present [at the meeting] … and today, I’m still saying the same thing,” says Tan, who has helmed IHH since January 2014.If the executive who had raised the question had subscribed for IHH shares at the time, his investment would have multiplied by now. IHH has gained more than 103% since its IPO, paid out almost RM1.15 billion or 17 sen a share in dividends and churned out RM4.53 billion in net profit since 2013.And, according to Tan, there is more to come. Using ageing as an analogy, he says, “We (IHH) are now into our twenties. So the road ahead … you know, in your twenties, you will transform — into your thirties, into your forties. When you reach your forties, you would have reached a level where it’s time to take stock and harvest … So today, we’re in our twenties going into our thirties, so if anything at all, I think we’ve only just begun.”And IHH has been aggressive, to say the least, steadily growing into the behemoth it is today.The group has under its belt such healthcare brands as Parkway, Pantai, Mount Elizabeth, Gleneagles, a 90% stake in Acibadem Holdings and a 31.17% stake in Fortis, and employs more than 55,000 people and operates more than 15,000 licensed beds across 84 hospitals in 12 countries — Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, India, China, Turkey, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Dubai, Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka.IHH acquired its 31.17% stake in Fortis Healthcare Ltd in a US$584 million deal in November last year, and the total investment is expected to reach US$1 billion (see accompanying story).Fortis Healthcare is listed on the Mumbai Stock Exchange in India and at its close of INR136.80 last Thursday, it had a market capitalisation of INR103.28 billion or US$1.49 billion (RM6.08 billion).Fortis owns 62.71% of Fortis Malar Hospitals Ltd, which is also an Indian publicly traded company and, according to Bloomberg, operates centres for trauma care. Fortis Malar has a market capitalisation of just US$14.91 million (RM60.89 million).Also last year, IHH upped its shareholding in Acibadem to 90% from 60% as part of a shareholders’ agreement signed when it had first bought into the latter.Through Parkway Investments Pte Ltd, IHH has a 35.25% stake in Singapore-listed ParkwayLife Real Estate Investment Trust, which, at its close of S$2.91 last Thursday, had a market capitalisation of S$1.76 billion (RM5.3 billion). ParkwayLife REIT houses IHH’s healthcare assets (see chart).At its close of RM5.60 last Thursday, IHH had a market capitalisation of RM49.11 billion, making it the second largest healthcare operator by market cap in the world.IHH’s partner in Gleneagles Hong Kong is NWS Holdings Ltd, a unit of the late billionaire Chen Yu Tung’s New World Development Co Ltd.The group is expected to open a hospital in Chengdu, China, in the second half of the year and one in Shanghai a year later with a total capacity of 350 beds and 450 beds respectively. Digitalising healthcareInterestingly enough, Tan says that over the next five years, IHH will be taking its healthcare offerings to a whole different level.In a nutshell, data from its 84 hospitals and millions of patients — their records, medication, past history and even lab results — will be placed on a common platform with the requisite cyber-security protection and precautions. This will improve IHH’s outreach to patients, enabling it to predict with accuracy and precision when they require intervention and what kind of preventive measures can be taken for them, and the size of the bill that insurance companies can work with.“In the next three to five years, IHH will have a huge IT arm transforming it into a more digitised and digital healthcare platform because we own 84 hospitals,” Tan says.This effort may not utilise much in terms of capital expenditure (capex) but it could have a significant effect on the company’s bottom line.However, amid the effort, IHH will continue with its acquisitions and expansion, and maintain its cutting edge in medical technology.Tan explains that IHH’s capex is a function of its operating budget every year, comprising replacement capex — which is required to keep a hospital in top condition — and new capex.Replacement capex can be anywhere between 2% and 3% of top-line operating revenue for a geographical region. For instance, IHH’s revenue in Singapore is over S$1 billion (RM3.01 billion), which means replacement capex in any given year is between S$30 million and S$50 million. The percentage is the same in IHH’s other markets.New capex, meanwhile, is decided on a case-by-case basis. “It’s a very disciplined way of doing it,” Tan says.Other than the above, there is also the possibility of IHH unlocking value in some of its assets. “We have plans,” Tan admits.According to Fortis’ latest annual report, it owns 62.5% of SRL Ltd, which operates pathology laboratories, and offers pathology services and radiology modalities, among others. SRL is India’s largest diagnostics chain and has more than 350 labs and 6,000 collection centres.In 2016, there was a plan to float SRL’s shares but this did not materialise.Adding to the drama at IHH, in November last year, state-controlled investment arm Khazanah Nasional Bhd sold a 16% stake in the company at RM6 a share or RM8.42 billion in total to Japan’s Mitsui & Co Ltd as part of an asset rationalisation exercise. After the disposal, Khazanah’s shareholding in IHH has fallen to 26.05% while Mitsui’s, at 32.9%, is just below the 33% threshold, which would trigger a general offer.“I don’t think there’s any significant impact. I think, thus far, we’ve worked very well with all the shareholders, normally directors on our board. Mitsui has been on the board for a long time, since 2012, from the listing until now,” Tan says of Khazanah’s disposal. IHH’s earningsIn its financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, IHH registered a net profit of RM627.69 million on revenue of RM11.52 billion. Earnings per share stood at 6.54 sen. Compared with FY2017, earnings were down 35.29% while revenue was up 3.41%.In its announcement to Bursa Malaysia, IHH said, “On constant currency terms, revenue and Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) grew 28% and 33% respectively. However, it is noteworthy that IHH made a RM554.5 million gain from the disposal of its interest in India’s Apollo Hospital Enterprise Ltd, and recognised in 2017.”In 3QFY2018, IHH suffered a net loss of RM107.07 million on sales of RM2.84 billion. This was attributed to Acibadem’s non-lira-denominated loans, which resulted in IHH recognising a foreign exchange loss of RM752.5 million.However, adding to its profit for a month or so was IHH’s acquisition of a 31.17% stake in Fortis in mid-November 2018. The consolidation resulted in an increase in revenue and expenses compared with the previous corresponding period (see accompanying story).Nevertheless, since its listing in July 2012, IHH’s net profit has fluctuated between RM612.4 million and RM969.95 million, largely because of currency volatility.Tan says, “We’re trying to look for ways and means to rationalise some of the assets (in Turkey). In the medium term, we should be able to reduce (debts by) another US$100 million to about US$300 million. Then, it becomes manageable. Then, you will not see swings, fluctuations in earnings.”At present, the Turkish lira is trading at about 5.64 to the US dollar but it had risen above 7.0 in August last year.As at Dec 31, 2018, IHH had cash and cash equivalents of RM7.76 billion, short-term debt commitments of RM9.33 billion and long-term borrowings of RM1.12 billion. Finance costs stood at RM978.82 million. Fortis issuesOf the analysts who have covered IHH since end-February this year, 10 have positive calls — “buy”, “outperform”, “add” or “overweight” — four have “hold” or “neutral” calls while three have negative calls — “underweight”, “underperform” or “sell”. Two research houses are reviewing their calls.For example, Credit Suisse has an “outperform” call and a target price of RM6.50 while UBS has a 12-month target price of RM6.60 and a “buy” call.“At its current price, the stock is trading at a PER of 43.4 times and EV/Ebitda of 16.7 times. Our ‘buy’ rating is premised on earnings growth this year from Singapore and Malaysia operations’ margin expansion; Gleneagles Hong Kong’s operations improving; IHH injecting equity and taking out some foreign currency debt at Acibadem level; and manageable start-up costs from opening the Chengdu hospital.”A slew of analyst reports were released earlier this month after IHH’s shares took a beating upon external auditor KPMG PLT issuing a qualified opinion on the healthcare group’s financials for FY2018.The stock fell 4.67% or 26 sen to RM5.31 as 4.9 million shares changed hands. The qualified opinion was the result of an ongoing investigation into Fortis by Indian regulators.Prior to IHH’s acquisition of its stake in Fortis, an independent external legal firm had submitted a report highlighting certain issues that required Fortis’ reassessment of claims and transactions with possibly related parties.What happened was that Fortis had investment placements — inter-corporate deposits (ICDs) — with three companies amounting to INR4,450 million (about RM261.2 million), impaired entirely by it in FY2018.The ICDs were used to repay and grant loans to certain entities, where former directors of Fortis were connected with the former controlling shareholders of the company. The placements, subsequent assignment and cancellation of the assignment were also done without following the usual treasury procedures and Fortis’ treasury mandate, and specific authorisation was not obtained from the former Fortis board.The third party, to which the ICDs were assigned, filed a civil suit against several entities, including Fortis, in February last year. The Securities and Exchange Board of India issued interim investigation orders after looking at the transactions, and instructed Fortis to take the necessary action to recover INR4,030 million from Fortis’ former controlling shareholders (prior to IHH) and other parties identified.“The financial impact of the auditor’s qualified opinion has already been provided for in the FY2018 audited accounts,” Tan says of the fiasco. “It is a technical announcement and the information has been disclosed and provided for by Fortis in its FY2018 financial results.“Since we acquired a controlling stake in Fortis in November last year, IHH has taken steps to address these qualifications together with Fortis. Separately, all the matters raised have been accounted for in the FY2018 financial statements.” ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-growing-ihh,"2019-05-01 20:04:48"

197,"April 16, 2019 15:00 pm +08",CIMB,"IPOs of private companies to drive market rebound this year","IT has been another slow start to the year for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Malaysia, but investment bankers are anticipating a pickup in the coming months.In any event, they do not expect 2019 to be worse than 2018 when the IPO market suffered its worst year since Bursa Malaysia’s inception in 1973.RHB Investment Bank Bhd CEO Robert Huray, for one, anticipates an improvement in listings in the months ahead.“We can expect [some] good quality growth companies, both from the public and private sectors, going public in 2019,” he tells The Edge.Last year, the exchange saw only two listings on the Main Market of Bursa, namely Mi Equipment Holdings Bhd and Techbond Group Bhd. The total amount raised in IPOs also plunged 91% to RM633.12 million — the lowest in 20 years — compared with 2017’s RM7.38 billion.Astramina Advisory Sdn Bhd managing director Wong Muh Rong says investors are still uncertain about Malaysia’s policies and ministers publicly airing their differences do not help matters.She cited the recent outburst involving Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Redzuan Md Yusof’s rebuke of his colleague Yeo Bee Yin, the minister of energy, science, technology, environment and climate change, over rare earths mining company Lynas Corp Ltd.“These sort of matters should be addressed in-house at Cabinet meetings,” Wong observes.An investment banker points out that companies are holding back on IPOs as they are afraid that they will not get the valuations they desire. “Bursa has been one of the worse performers in Asia year to date.”YTD, the FBM KLCI has fallen 2.9% to close at 1,641.81 points last Friday.Nevertheless, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s remarks at the two-day Invest Malaysia conference last month, suggesting Putrajaya could be looking to list mature government-linked entities, have stirred up some interest in the IPO market.“If you want to excite the IPO market [with the listing of government-linked companies], let’s do a really good one. We must pick something that Malaysia is good at, and Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is one of them,” says Astramina’s Wong.“Petronas is already run like an international public listed company, so it will have little trouble finding investors and proving its value,” she adds.Three of its units — Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and Petronas Dagangan Bhd — are already listed on Bursa, with their market capitalisation at RM72.8 billion, RM34.67 billion and RM24.84 billion respectively.However, a head of a local investment bank is sceptical of a public share sale of Petronas as the national oil company is considered a strategic asset to the government.Pointing to plans for the domestic and international listing of Saudi oil giant Aramco as well as China’s Sinopec Marketing Co, a subsidiary of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, Wong opines that a divestment of even a 30% to 40% stake would be sufficient to excite the IPO market.“The listing [of Petronas] may not be this year, but they can start working on the documentation for the IPO and then launch it once market conditions improve.”Wong expects more mergers and acquisitions and restructuring activities this year, but stresses, “We still need to see more progress in reform efforts by the [Pakatan Harapan-led] government after one year.”Investors are also keenly watching QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd’s IPO, which is set to be the country’s biggest listing since that of integrated petrochemical producer Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd, which raised RM4 billion in July 2017.QSR’s largest shareholder, Johor Corp, is seeking to raise as much as RM2 billion from the IPO, which could value the company at some RM6 billion.Johor Corp president and CEO Datuk Kamaruzzaman Abu Kassim said last May that private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) were looking to exit the fast-food operator.Initially slated for the first half of the year, the IPO may face further delays as its shareholders want higher valuations, a source close to the deal tells The Edge. The desire for richer valuations is telling, considering that QSR’s IPO has been planned since 2016.Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) data shows that QSR’s net profit grew 4.7% to RM192.59 million in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018), from RM183.95 million in FY2017. Revenue rose a marginal 1% to RM4.61 billion from RM4.56 billion in FY2017.According to investment bankers, the potential listing of other government-linked entities include Malayan Banking Bhd’s (Maybank) insurance arm Etiqa International Holdings Sdn Bhd (EIH), Axiata Group Bhd’s 62.37%-owned unit edotco Group Sdn Bhd, highway concessionaire Projek Lintasan Kota Holdings Sdn Bhd (Prolintas), Felcra Bhd and the Airport Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).It is understood that Maybank has started making preparations for a possible IPO of Etiqa, including seeking Bank Negara Malaysia’s approval.Maybank’s stake in Etiqa is parked under wholly-owned EIH, which has a 69.05% stake in Maybank Ageas Holdings Bhd, while Brussels-based insurer Ageas NV holds the remaining equity interest.A listing of Etiqa would certainly appeal to the market given its relative size and pedigree. Although EIH’s net profit fell 9% year on year to RM700.84 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, net interest income rose 6.4% y-o-y to RM1.16 billion last year.In an April report last year, CIMB Research pegged Etiqa’s market capitalisation upon listing at between RM5.3 billion and RM10.7 billion, based on a price-to-book value (P/BV) of 1.4 times to 2.8 times. It used Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd’s P/BV as a benchmark.Rumours of Maybank preparing to spin off and list Etiqa have been doing the rounds since 2016, however.At present, Etiqa is the clear leader in the general takaful segment with a market share of more than 50%. It ranks No 3 on the family takaful list, with a market share of 15%.“If you’re launching an IPO, you need to ensure that the company is market ready and the listing optimises the valuation for its shareholders,” says a senior director with a local investment bank, who declined to be named.“But there is liquidity on the side and investors are willing to pay for better assets. Personally, I’m thinking that more immediate [ones] could be things like the possible restructuring of Malaysia Airlines Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd because recent large-cap IPOs have disappointed.“I think the only one that possibly has the most traction could be the Airport REIT,” the senior director adds.Under Budget 2019, the government, being the asset owner of almost all commercial airports in Malaysia, had proposed to set up the world’s first Airport REIT. It had set a target of raising RM4 billion by selling a 30% stake in the REIT to private investment institutions.However, last November, the Malaysian Aviation Commission pointed out that the Airport REIT exercise will only be carried out after the regulated asset base framework and the user fee structure have been negotiated and finalised between the government and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd. That is slated to be completed this year.The idea to list Prolintas was first mooted in March 2017 by then Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) group chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, who had set an end-2018 to early 2019 target.However, investment bankers say a flotation of Prolintas, wholly owned by PNB, is unlikely to take place this year as the government needs to sort out its privatisation policy for highway tolls first.Based on SSM data, the highway concessionaire has been posting losses for the past five years, which widened to RM100.1 million in FY2017 compared with RM31.38 million in FY2016. Revenue, however, rose 58% y-o-y to RM317.41 million in FY2017.Thus, most investment bankers are of the view that the IPOs coming to market this year will be heavily geared towards private companies rather than government-linked entities. Big IPOs on the horizon are family-owned poultry group Leong Hup International Bhd and MR.DIY, the country’s biggest home improvement retailer.According to news reports, Leong Hup is looking to raise as much as US$600 million (RM2.49 billion) and MR.DIY, RM1.5 billion.Leong Hup posted a 7.5% y-o-y fall in net profit to RM247.41 million in FY2017, on a 4.6% rise in revenue to RM5.5 billion. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ipos-private-companies-drive-market-rebound-year,"2019-05-01 20:04:53"

(April 15, RM5.75)
Maintain add with a higher target price (TP) of RM6.50: RHB Bank Bhd raised its base rate (BR) by 10 basis points (bps) to 4% on April 5, 2019. We found this unsurprising as three other banks had done so over the past six months based on our checks — Bank Islam (BR +13bps to 4.03% on Nov 13, 2018); CIMB Bank (BR +10bps to 4.25% on Dec 4, 2018); and Hong Leong Bank (BR +10bps to 4.13% on Jan 10, 2019).The increase in BR is positive for RHB Bank as this will raise the interest income earned from its loan portfolio. The additional interest income from this will flow to the bottom line as we do not expect banks’ costs — interest expense, overheads and credit costs — to be affected by the BR hike. We estimate the rise in BR will lift RHB Bank’s net profit by about 5% and net interest margin, 7bps for financial years 2020 and 2021 forecasts (FY20-FY21F).RHB Bank’s FY20-FY21F net profit, expected to increase about 5%, will be able to offset our estimated reduction of about 5% for FY20-FY21F net profit if there is a reduction in the overnight policy rate later this year. However, from RHB Bank’s perspective, it increased the BR due to a rise in cost of funds and not because of the negative impact of any anticipated rate cut. In fact, RHB Bank expects interest rates to remain unchanged in 2019F.We raised our earnings per share forecasts by 4% for FY19F and about 5% for FY20-FY21F, factoring in the 10bps hike in the BR. This also upped our dividend discount model-based TP from RM6.38 to RM6.50.Our “add” rating for RHB Bank remains as well as being our top pick for the sector given its attractive valuation at calendar year 2020F price-to-earnings ratio of 8.1 times and price-to-book value of 0.8 times, and improvements from the transformation programme. A potential rerating catalyst is a higher net profit as a result of the BR hike.

The railway will now be 648km — 40km shorter than previously — and pass through Jelebu, Negeri Sembilan, instead of Gombak in the Klang Valley.CIMB Research, however, maintains its “underweight” rating on the construction sector pending more details on the EPCC terms and tender portions for local contractors, which may form upside risks for local players.“Under our coverage, potential beneficiaries include IJM Corp Bhd, Sunway Bhd (via Sunway Construction Group Bhd) and WCT Holdings Bhd,” said CIMB research.IJM Corp closed two sen or 0.88% lower to RM2.25, while Sunway Construction rose three sen or 1.55% to RM1.96. WCT also closed higher by 0.5 sen or 0.52% to 96.5 sen.Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd senior analyst Kenneth Leong concurred that most contractors have likely already reacted to the news beforehand. Any fresh catalysts for buy-in would be updated on the terms for local contractors, he said.“Stocks to look at would be IJM Corp as it has experience in road and rail projects. Gamuda Bhd and Gadang Holdings are also contenders,” he told The Edge Financial Daily when contacted.Gamuda closed six sen or 1.88% lower to RM3.13, while Gadang lost 2.5 sen or 3.52% to settle at 68.5 sen.Shares of building material stocks such as Lafarge Malaysia Bhd and Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd, which are also said to be contenders to benefit from the ECRL project had traded in positive territory early yesterday before paring gains at market close.Lafarge Malaysia closed three sen lower or 1.21% to RM2.45, while Press Metal closed unchanged at RM4.53. Ann Joo Resources Bhd also ended eight sen or 4.47% lower to RM1.71.In a research note yesterday, AllianceDBS noted that the revival of the ECRL project is a small win as it is likely that CCCC would also revive the cement supply contract (worth RM270mil then) signed with Lafarge in 2016. The contract was cancelled last year following the suspension of the project.“We estimate if the RM270 million contract remains, this will translate into [about] 1.2 million tonnes of cement demand – spread over the next four years, equivalent to 300,000 tonnes per year. This is relatively small compared to Lafarge’s effective capacity of 8.2 million tonnes.

202,"April 15, 2019 17:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Newsbreak: Ezion deal allows Yinson to tap China’s RE sector","YINSON Holdings Bhd’s proposed acquisition of US$916 million (RM3,736.45 million) of Ezion Holdings Ltd’s debt will allow the Malaysian offshore marine services provider to participate in the renewable energy (RE) plant installation sector, especially in China.As China rushes to increase the non-fossil energy share of total primary energy consumption to 15% and 20% by 2020 and 2030 respectively, some estimate that it will require about US$360 billion over the next decade. Ezion’s joint venture with several Chinese companies may enable Yinson to participate in the burgeoning sector, especially in the wind farm market.According to BIMB Securities analyst Azim Faris, who covers Yinson, the wind farm market is more mature in the EU and the US but there is higher interest among Asian and other developing countries in adopting wind parks on a larger scale.“Last year, an estimated 20GW to 21GW of wind power capacity was installed in China and Taiwan to generate energy. As such, this bodes well for Ezion, which already has a strong market presence in Asia,” Azim tells The Edge.In 2016, Ezion set up a joint venture with Sinotrans & CSC Holdings Co Ltd to secure opportunities in China’s offshore wind farm market. The agreement also includes a partnership with China Huadian Corporation Ltd to support offshore wind power installation projects in the country.However, it may be challenging for Ezion to benefit from the Chinese wind farm market, depending on how the company chooses to solve its working capital issues. This is why Yinson’s proposed acquisition of Ezion will have to go through the debt route rather than equity, analysts say.To recap, Yinson proposed to acquire the US$916 million of debt for a cash outlay of US$200 million from Ezion’s secured lenders. Subsequently, the debts will be capitalised and converted into Ezion’s shares via share issuance at a price of 5.5 Singapore cents apiece.This will result in Yinson eventually holding a stake of not less than 70% in the Singaporean tug boat and lift boat operator.Apart from the proposed acquisition, Yinson may also choose to inject some S$203 million over the next five years in return for 3.4 billion shares, or a 11% stake.The deal to buy up to US$916 million worth of secured bank borrowings from the lenders has not yet been signed as discussions, which are at an advanced stage, are still ongoing. If Yinson and the banks fail to reach an agreement by April 14, the proposal will be terminated.The lift boat business is Ezion’s largest revenue contributor, generating about 60% of its total revenue of US$118.7 million in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18).According to UOB KayHian senior analyst Kong Ho Meng, both the group and Ezion sees the limited working capital to execute their contracts as the biggest near-term hurdle to the lift boat business earnings.However, he says the issue is expected to be resolved quickly once Yinson steps in as a shareholder of Ezion and eases the debt.“In this sense and if you look at Ezion’s past historical statements, the lift boat segmental Ebitda of US$77 million in 2016 is the best representation of how the segment should perform without major loan constraint,” says Kong in an emailed response to The Edge.Despite that, BIMB Securities’ Azim says there is still the risk that the lift boat redeployment process will be slower than expected. Yinson plans to increase Ezion’s Ebitda to US$120 million in 18 months, from US$49 million in FY2018, by increasing its utilisation of the lift boats.“Should this happen, it would translate into a longer payback period than Yinson’s management had initially expected,” says Azim. Ezion has 12 lift boats in its fleet, all of which are contracted. However, only about 50% of the contracts were executed due to the working capital issue.The company has been hit by the drop in oil prices since 2014, which led to plummeting charter rates.Meanwhile, the need to integrate the same culture, work and business direction of the two companies is definitely a challenge for the acquisition’s success, according to Maybank Kim Eng analyst Liaw Thong Jung.“Yinson will drive Ezion with a new direction and purpose. That will mean further strengthening of its balance sheet and operations. With a cleaner balance sheet and new owner, Ezion will have better access to the capital market.“Lifting its operating assets utilisation (lift boats, rigs, offshore support vessels, tugs, barges and so on) is also a priority. Yinson will also need to look at the assets on hand, which are considered core and which are not,” says Liaw, adding that the research firm does not rule out asset rationalisation.Post-restructuring, Ezion’s gross debt will be reduced by 60% to US$597 million, giving it a net asset balance of US$555 million compared with a net liability balance of US$352 million as at Dec 31, 2018.Analysts covering Yinson are largely positive on the acquisition. This is because the cash outlay of US$200 million, which effectively values Ezion at only 0.35 times its post-restructuring book value, gives Yinson a relatively attractive entry point to diversify its business into lift boats and wind farm installation.Raymond Yap, a CIMB Research analyst who covers Yinson, says the entry price was at a 48.5% discount to Ezion’s post-restructuring net asset of 2.9 Singapore cents per share, or a pro forma FY18 price-to-book value of 0.52 times.Nevertheless, Yap foresees that Ezion will slightly drag down Yinson’s profitability for the financial year ending Jan 31, 2020 (FY2020). This is based on Ezion’s estimated core pretax loss of US$49 million, of which 70%, or US$34 million, is consolidated by Yinson.However, since the acquisition is expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year, and assuming there is a three-month consolidation of Ezion into Yinson’s financials, the negative drag is 18% of Yinson’s estimated core pretax profit, says Yap in the research note.“We expect Yinson to deliver strong core pretax profits of US$132 million in its FY21F, almost tripling year on year, due to the commissioning of the FPSO Helang and FPSO Abigail-Joseph projects from November 2019 onwards.“At the same time, we estimate Ezion to report lower core pretax losses of US$9 million in CY20F, of which US$6 million is attributable to Yinson’s potential 70% stake. As a result, the negative impact on Yinson from Ezion’s losses, if any, in CY20F, will be much less at only 5% of our current forecast for Yinson,” he says. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/newsbreak-ezion-deal-allows-yinson-tap-chinas-re-sector,"2019-05-01 20:04:56"
203,"April 15, 2019 16:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Newsbreak: Wan Fadzmi said to be top contender for Bank Rakyat MD role","THE former Agrobank CEO, Datuk Wan Mohd Fadzmi Wan Othman, is said to be the top contender for the post of president and managing director at Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia Bhd (Bank Rakyat). Sources say he is the likeliest candidate to succeed Datuk Zulkiflee Abbas Abdul Hamid, who officially left the group on April 2 at the end of his two-year contract.“He is the Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) preferred candidate,” a source tells The Edge.Bank Rakyat is the country’s largest development financial institution (DFI) with total assets of RM106.5 billion as at June 30 last year. It is also the second largest Islamic lender after Maybank Islamic Bhd.An Islamic cooperative bank, Bank Rakyat falls under the control of the Ministry of Entrepreneur Development (MED). However, because it is also governed by the Bank Rakyat (Special Provisions) Act 1978, which allows it to provide financing to non-members, the MoF also has a say in major matters.According to sources, it has taken longer than expected to appoint a new CEO due to differences in opinion between the two ministries over who should be in the driving seat.Bank Rakyat had announced as early as Jan 23 that Zulkiflee planned to step down when his contract ended. This came as no surprise as Zulkiflee, a veteran banker who came out of retirement to take on the top job in April 2017, had indicated from the start that he did not intend to stay for the long term. He is understood to have started his leave in March.According to sources, a headhunter was hired to look for candidates. One who had the favour of MED was shortlisted, but it is understood that the MoF is backing Wan Fadzmi.“The bank has shortlisted several external and internal candidates who will undergo a strict internal and Bank Negara Malaysia evaluation process. The thorough process is essential to ensure the right candidate is chosen.  The final appointment  is expected to be made by end April,” a spokesperson from MED tells The Edge.  Wan Fadzmi, who left Agrobank on Aug 31, 2017, after a six-year stint, has extensive experience in banking at home and abroad. He was with Malayan Banking Bhd for 22 years, during which time he held various senior management positions, including as CEO and country head for the bank’s operations in London, New York and Hong Kong. After Maybank, he became director of global financial banking for the strategic business group at RHB Bank Bhd, before joining Agrobank — then known as Bank Pertanian (M) Bhd — as CEO in July 2011.He currently sits on the boards of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp Malaysia Bhd, Chemical Co of  Malay­sia Bhd and Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd as an independent non-executive director.In late June last year, the government had named Wan Fadzmi as part of the new executive committee to manage troubled 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).The choice of CEO at Bank Rakyat is important as it comes at a time when Bank Negara is undertaking a holistic review of the existing regulatory framework for DFIs. In its recently released Financial Stability and Payment Systems Report 2018, Bank Negara said the move was “to reflect the roles and specific mandates of DFIs, and ensure that prudential standards remain appropriate to the risk profiles of individual DFIs.“This envisages greater differentiation at an individual institution level, while ensuring that market distortions are minimised. As part of the review, [Bank Negara] plans to consult on proposed revisions to 10 core prudential standards applicable to DFIs over the coming year,” the central bank said.Bank Rakyat reported a profit after tax and zakat of RM664.6 million for the six months to June 30, 2018, a decrease of 24.8% from a year earlier. This was due mainly to a 12% rise in allowance for impairment losses on financial assets to RM305.4 million in the period.Bank Rakyat is unlike ordinary commercial banks. Set up under the Co-operative Societies Act 1993, it is a cooperative bank that does mainly retail banking — almost 90% of its assets are retail assets — and the bulk of its customers are civil servants.The bank’s business has long been skewed towards personal financing (PF). This is something it has tried to address in the last two years as it looks to grow more sustainably over the long term.Last year, the bank embarked on a five-year strategic plan (2018-2022) aimed at growing PF at a more controlled pace of under 1% a year, while expanding its focus on home, auto and SME financing. It also accelerated growth in its Islamic pawnbroking business known as Ar-Rahnu.On Dec 6 last year, MED announced the appointment of Datuk Noripah Kamso as the new chairman of Bank Rakyat, as well as two new board members — Wan Suraya Wan Mohd Radzi (secretary-general of the MED) and Edham Reza Shah Abdul Rahman (an advocate and solicitor).Noripah was formerly the chief executive of CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management Sdn Bhd. She replaced Tan Sri Shukry Mohd Salleh, who was dismissed from the post in November last year following his alleged involvement in tampering with the original audit report on 1MDB when he was the chief private secretary of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/newsbreak-wan-fadzmi-said-be-top-contender-bank-rakyat-md-role,"2019-05-01 20:04:57"
204,"April 15, 2019 16:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Cover Story: Beverly Hills of Kuala Lumpur sees solid values and demand","The long-established Bukit Tunku is perched on a hill, overlooking the city centre. Surrounded by mature greenery and tree-lined roads, it is recognised as one of the prime residential areas of Kuala Lumpur.Located on the western fringes of the capital, Bukit Tunku boasts mainly luxury detached homes, mansions, vacant residential land and low-rise condominiums. Nearby landmarks include Duta Tennis Stadium and Sunway Putra Mall. Taman Botani Perdana as well as attractions such as the Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, Planetarium Negara and Carcosa Seri Negara are also a short distance away, consultants point out.Previously known as Kenny Hills, Bukit Tunku was renamed after the late Tunku Abdul Rahman, who used to reside there. The neighbourhood exudes an air of exclusivity and is home to some prominent figures. “Bukit Tunku has a long history for being an affluent and a sought-after address for the wealthy set,” says LaurelCap Sdn Bhd executive director Stanley Toh. “The landed properties here are mainly individually designed detached houses. The land parcels are also large, measuring from one to four acres. Residents in the area are mainly tycoons, royalty and prominent figures who are able to afford homes there.”Metro Rec Sdn Bhd managing director Ng Weng Yew concurs. “Bukit Tunku is often touted as the Beverly Hills of Malaysia and is a prestigious address for wealthy locals and expatriates. It comprises residential detached houses, vacant plots interspersed with low-rise strata condominiums boasting low density of 40 persons per acre, according to the Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020.“As Bukit Tunku is sited right next to the central business district of Kuala Lumpur, divided by Jalan Kuching, it is close to all commercial and retail facilities of the city centre. To the southwest is another upmarket residential address, Taman Duta,” Ng says, commenting on Bukit Tunku’s excellent location.“Taman Duta comprises mostly leasehold land. Historically, Taman Duta has had many residents who are government servants [who were given some land as tokens of appreciation for their decades of service]. This was a common practice back then. Meanwhile, Bukit Tunku is mainly made up of freehold private land,” says Toh.Although it does not have public transport, Bukit Tunku is still well connected and accessible via Lebuhraya Duta — Sungai Buloh, North-South Expressway and Lebuhraya Sultan Iskandar. The Putra Komuter Station is nearby.The neighbourhood is flanked by major roads such as Jalan Tuanku Abdul Halim, Jalan Segambut, Jalan Ipoh, Jalan Kuching, Jalan Tun Ismail and Jalan Perhentian. Solid values and demandDespite the sluggish market sentiment, Bukit Tunku maintains its values, occupancy and overall demand. Apart from its lavish residential homes and vacant land, newer gated-and-guarded developments are built in the last few years. “There are not that many vacant parcels up for sale in this market. In the past decade or so, more [landed] gated and guarded schemes were developed in Bukit Tunku such as Impian Bukit Tunku by Bukit Tunku Elite Properties Sdn Bhd and Kenny Vale by Tan & Tan Developments. The take-up rates were generally good,” observes Metro Rec’s Ng.“Most of the strata residential schemes in Bukit Tunku are well occupied, with a significant number of expatriates, largely due to the area’s close proximity to the city centre, greenery and low density.”It appears that demand for residential landed properties here is steadier than that for non-landed properties, says LaurelCap’s Toh. “This could be attributed to the local council’s low-density development guidelines, so developers are forced to build large condominiums, which contributes to the final selling prices being out of the reach of many buyers. As such, the demand spills over to neighbouring areas such as Mont’Kiara, Sri Hartamas and Damansara Heights,” he says.For the residential segment, the average built-ups for landed properties range from 5,000 to 10,000 sq ft. According to Toh, the average prices of landed properties in Bukit Tunku are between RM350 and RM700 psf (depending on the terrain). Meanwhile, average rents are between RM2 psf and RM3.30 psf per month, with yields of 2% to 3%.As for non-landed properties, the average prices are from RM850 to RM1,100 psf. Average rents are from RM2.50 to RM3.50 psf per month, with yields of 3% to 4%, adds Toh.Development in Bukit Tunku is controlled, he adds. “They are mostly extensions of residential properties by individual owners. For example, there are approved residential projects that date back to September 2012, comprising a few units of 3-storey bungalows with basements and swimming pools.”According to Toh, there are a couple of projects that are in the pipeline or waiting for approvals in Bukit Tunku. “According to Portal OSC, there are projects that are in the works in Bukit Tunku. There is a project comprising two blocks of apartment villas that date back to 2016, and another project comprising eight blocks (146 units) of residential villas that date back in 2017,” says Toh. Details are still scarce, he adds.In terms of the commercial segment, there is only one row of shoplots under Taman Tunku Apartments off Langgak Tunku by Selangor Properties Bhd. The leafy thoroughfare is frequented by residents in the area. “CIMB Bank, Kenny Hills Bakery and Kenny Hills Bistro are located there. I believe the properties there are not for sale but for rent only,” says Toh. “Average rents [for commercial properties] are between RM3 and RM5 psf per month.“The area attracts mainly owner-occupiers, some with large wealthy families [of many generations]. Most of the parents living in Bukit Tunku [for decades] buy properties for their children in the area as well. Alternatively, some of these families opt to have a few generations stay in one large mansion [but designed with different accesses] to maintain their privacy,” says Toh. Firm outlookLiving in the neighbourhood has its perks. “Bukit Tunku offers the status [of luxury living]. It has lush greenery as well as private and quiet surroundings,” says Ng. “The higher grounds and commanding views fetch higher values for the properties as well.”Bukit Tunku also has an active residents’ association that organises community events and monitors the safety of the area.Nearby amenities include Damai Service Hospital, Sentosa Medical Centre and Kuala Lumpur Sports Medicine Centre. Academic institutions are Open University Malaysia, Universiti Tun Abdul Razak and SM Sains Seri Puteri.Nonetheless, there are some challenges. “The neighbourhood is rather isolated, hence, there is concern about security. Due to its greenery, the area attracts pests, mosquitoes, snakes and even monkeys,” says Ng. “There is also traffic congestion, with an increasing number of drivers using Bukit Tunku as a way to cut through the jam [in the city centre] during peak hours.”Toh agrees. “The traffic congestion is [mainly] along Jalan Duta and Jalan Kuching.“The terrain of Bukit Tunku is generally hilly, which adds to the development cost [of houses] as slope maintenance is expensive,” he says. “It may increase the construction cost [of houses] here as well, which in turn will restrict the price growth of land in the area.”Ng adds, “The low-density [regulation] imposed here may hinder development on larger parcels with unfavourable terrain.”There are, however, some catalysts. “The value of properties in Bukit Tunku is underpinned by the freehold tenure of the land. Its location is also a key driver of prices and value of properties,” says Toh. “The personalities living here add to the opulence as well.”Moving forward, the outlook for Bukit Tunku appears secure. “The forecast in terms of value and development seems positive. Bukit Tunku is still irreplaceable in terms of address and prestige … as the crème de la crème live here. Its value should hold steady even in a downturn, given the purchaser profile here,” Ng says. “[Future] developments would be slow due to its density guidelines and physical site challenges.”“The outlook for Bukit Tunku is still bright. Property values are still on an upward trend, but the pace is slower,” concludes Toh.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-beverly-hills-kuala-lumpur-sees-solid-values-and-demand,"2019-05-01 20:04:57"

However, the rights issue of ordinary shares was undersubscribed. The subscription rate was 81.5%.The remaining unsubscribed rights shares have been fully taken up by the joint underwriters, namely Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, CIMB Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd.Back on last week’s share sales, the shares changed hands through several off-market deals at 31 sen per share as Bloomberg data shows. The transaction price was one sen above the group’s rights issue price of 30 sen, but it was below the closing price of 34 sen for both days.The number of shares sold was equivalent to a 3.76% stake based on the issued share capital of 15.93 billion shares.

206,"April 15, 2019 09:02 am +08",CIMB,"When defensive stocks are no longer a bear-market safe haven","KUALA LUMPUR: Defensive stocks such as utilities, consumer staples and healthcare are not such a good place to hide out anymore.Indeed, for Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng, there is no such thing as a defensive stock in current market conditions.“Putting your money in the bank is a safer bet [for potentially higher returns] than investing in defensive stocks for now,” he told The Edge Financial Daily, pointing to today’s volatile, uncertain market and economic environment.Ang suggests using the bottom-up approach when picking stocks. This means investors should be looking for stocks that have good growth prospects or strong fundamentals.“If the [share] price is attractive and [the company’s] growth [prospects] are good, then it will serve as a buying opportunity,” he added.The FBM KLCI fell to a fresh two-year low last Thursday, closing at 1,624.23 points, as heightened concerns over slower global economic growth prompted investors to seek refuge in safe havens. The benchmark index inched up 5.94 points or 0.37% to close at 1,630.17 last Friday.Last week’s downward revision of the 2019 global growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund to 3.3% from 3.5% did not help matters. The fund had earlier this year revised down its growth forecast from 3.6%.Nomura head of equity research for Malaysia Tushar Mohata agrees that now is not the right time to turn to defensive stocks.That is because the defensive stocks on Bursa Malaysia have underperformed their Asean counterparts “significantly” due to strong outflows from foreign portfolio investors, he said.According to last Monday’s fund flow report by MIDF Research, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, foreign funds have sold RM1.76 billion net of local equities. Among the four Asean markets (Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines) it monitors, Malaysia has now surpassed Thailand to become the nation with the largest foreign net outflow.“Investors may want to consider looking at high beta stocks, which are trading at steep discount to their long-term average trading multiples. The near-term catalysts of these stocks could be improving earnings momentum,” said Tushar.He believes that these high beta stocks are likely to rally when Bursa reverses course and outperforms its peers in Asean.His top picks are CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd.For investors who want exposure to defensive sectors, Tushar pointed out that real estate investment trusts (REITs) are one due to their stable yield.RHB Research Institute head of Malaysian research Alexander Chia said for domestic investors that need to remain invested in local equities, the preservation of capital will be a key priority.“Adding some defensive names to one’s portfolio continues to make tactical sense, given the prevailing risks that are still unfolding. These companies should have strong earnings resilience that can ride through market upheavals,” he added.Chia is recommending stocks such as Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Mynews Holdings Bhd, Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd and QL Resources Bhd.However, in the short term, Chia said investors should be aware of the persistent selling by foreign portfolio investors and hence, be wary of stocks with large foreign shareholdings.He also noted that only large-cap stocks have underperformed this year, while small-cap stocks have performed well.YTD, the FBM Small Cap Index has risen 18.29% to close at 13,365.62 points last Friday, while the KLCI has fallen 3.57%.Noting that it is a trading market now, Chia said funds need to make money and achieve alpha or active returns on their investments.“The market is now very short-term and the valuation [of Malaysian stocks] is not that cheap even at current levels,” he added.Hence, he opined that investors should look for pockets of opportunity, beaten down stocks, value buys and undervalued stocks. Silver lining in defensive stocksWhile current market conditions have not been really positive and it is seen that even defensive stocks have been underperforming so far this year, analysts still see some silver lining in defensive stocks.UOB Kay Hian Malaysia research head Vincent Khoo expects defensive stocks to underperform the broader market in the near term, as the government steps up fiscal stimulus activities via megaprojects.This is also to respect the sanctity of government contracts, especially pertaining to its proposed acquisition of Gamuda’s highways, he said.“In such a scenario, we foresee improved investor confidence and foreign equity flows turning positive,” he added.However, there are still some defensive stocks which continue to have modest appeal and these include high dividend yielders such as IGB REIT and Magnum Bhd.Khoo said stocks that will continue to remain attractive include selective beneficiaries of megaprojects and trade diversion.Meanwhile, stocks to avoid include selective glove manufacturers as clarity on demand and supply dynamics is needed; selective technology companies on the back of anticipated weak first quarter of 2019 results season; and Telekom Malaysia Bhd where UOB Kay Hian will need to assess the magnitude of its fall in broadband access average revenue per user.MIDF Research head Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman is of the view that defensive stocks can still be a safe haven when it comes to consumer consumption and dividend play.In relation to consumption, he noted that the distributive trade was still growing at 6.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) in February, albeit moderating from 7.8% y-o-y in the previous month, due to a shorter month and the festive holidays.Retail growth was 8.5% y-o-y, while wholesale and motor vehicles grew 5.8% y-o-y and 2.4% y-o-y respectively.“This shows consumption remains strong among Malaysians,” said Redza.He said stocks with “still strong earnings”, coupled with stable dividend payments, should also be considered amid these trying times.“Companies with strong earnings would provide a stable flow of future dividends and with market sentiment negatively affecting the price movements, this could present a good opportunity to accumulate stocks with high dividend yields.“So, investors shouldn’t just look at historical dividend payments alone; they also have to look at the defensiveness of the companies’ profits,” he added.MIDF Research is recommending stocks such as DiGi.Com Bhd, MBM Resources Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and UOA Development Bhd.Despite concerns over a potential cut in the overnight policy rate by Bank Negara Malaysia, which may negatively impact banks’ profitability, Redza also likes CIMB and Malayan Banking Bhd, noting that their share prices have fallen a lot over the past year.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/when-defensive-stocks-are-no-longer-bearmarket-safe-haven,"2019-05-01 20:04:58"

208,"April 14, 2019 11:30 am +08",CIMB,"Banking: Rise of challenger banks in Asia","Challenger banks have been a trend in markets such as the UK in the last few years, but activity is ramping up in Asian markets like South Korea, Greater China and Southeast Asia, says James Lloyd, fintech and payments leader for Asia-Pacific at EY, in the recently published Citi GPS: Global Perspectives and Solutions report, titled “Bank X: The New New Bank”.“While we have been supporting emergent players for quite some time, it is in the past year that I have dedicated a large majority of my time to this area. There is a huge amount going on across Asia-Pacific,” he tells the authors of the report.In Hong Kong specifically, regulatory and infrastructure change is driving a tremendous level of challenger-related activity, says Lloyd. “By way of context, in May last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority published a revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks. In effect, this allows new players to apply for a retail bank licence, with a particular focus on non-traditional players.“Hong Kong is not the first market in Asia to seek to issue new licences in this way. But it does have particular significance, given the city’s status as an international finance centre, the availability of capital and potential access to the Greater China market.”He describes a challenger or virtual bank as a digital-only proposition, one with no branch network. Apart from having an impact on costs, foregoing traditional physical infrastructure, more importantly, also has an impact on the customer experience, he says.“Virtual or digital banks typically involve online customer onboarding, servicing and engagement. Of course, the specific results, products and services can take many different forms, particularly as a range of different players — from incumbents to platforms — seek to build their own digital-only or challenger banks.“DBS Bank, for example, has already launched a mobile-only proposition in the growth markets of India and Indonesia. Similarly, CIMB Bank and other regional banks have announced that they are in the process of launching digital-only or mobile-only propositions in markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam. In Hong Kong, Standard Chartered Bank has announced that it is in the process of seeking authorisation for a digital-only virtual-bank proposition.”According to the report, these new banks are designed around meeting customer expectations, leveraging data insights through agile technology stacks to improve personalisation and offering fully-digital banking experiences. “Challenger banks also tend to be quicker at incorporating new products or processes into their platform and help easily connect with third-party products, offering more choices to the end-user.” Banks, big tech taking the leadThe authors of the Citi report say challenger banks in Asia are mostly backed by large technology or telecommunications players or traditional banks. For example, WeBank, Mybank and Kakao Bank are backed by tech firms Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Kakao respectively.“Challenger banks originating from start-ups intending to disrupt financial services in Asia (for example, Neat in Hong Kong and Paytm in India) are by far fewer than those originating from start-ups in the UK (for example, Metro Bank, Monzo, Starling Bank and Tandem Bank). A limited regulatory framework for challengers in Asia (with the emerging exception of Hong Kong) and the presence of large tech companies (especially in China) may be some of the reasons Asian challengers are more likely to be an offshoot of a bank or telco,” says the report.Why are so many traditional banking players coming up with their own challenger banks? Lloyd says the incumbent banks in Asia are seeing first-hand the impact technology-led platform players can have on customer interactions as they expand beyond their anchor use cases and move laterally into financial services.Many bank CEOs and management teams in the region are re-examining their current propositions and seeking to double down on all aspects of digital customer engagement, says Lloyd. One question to consider is whether to continue investing in existing infrastructure or seek to replace it, either in part or en masse, with a new digital technology stack.“This is where the opportunity for ‘greenfield’ solutions could be especially powerful — building something off to the side, using components that could perhaps ultimately be brought back into the core proposition. There are huge opportunities associated with building solutions unencumbered by legacy technology, processes and mindsets,” he says.“That is not to say that all legacy is necessarily bad. Think of the advantages of proven risk management functions, for example. But a combination of both innovative and trusted solutions can be quite powerful.”In addition to existing banks launching new challenger propositions, other players such as growth-stage start-ups and platforms with an established customer base are also getting involved, says Lloyd. “In the UK, we have seen a range of new start-ups raise funding, build new propositions and begin to organically acquire customers.“In Asia, platform players are beginning to emerge. Kakao Bank in South Korea, for example, is built on top of the country’s largest mobile messaging service. Similarly, in China, the large internet players have sought to capitalise on their extensive ecosystems by launching a range of first and third-party financial services.”Lloyd observes a factor that will be especially visible in Asia, that is, building something new provides an opportunity to drive deep strategic partnerships with a variety of players at an equity shareholding level. He says this could be between banks and non-banks, technology players and distribution partners or some combination thereof.“In fact, I would go so far as to say that a defining feature of challenger banks in Asia will be the emergence of multi-party joint ventures seeking to create true partner ‘ecosystems’ that extend beyond financial services into other areas such as travel, transport, retail and telecommunications,” he adds. Challenges for the challengersLloyd and his team have been supporting the design and development of several “greenfield” challenger banks in Asia. In the last 12 months or so of setting them up, the biggest challenge for new players is getting licensed, he says.“In Hong Kong at least, the regulator has focused on applicants that can demonstrate sufficient financial, technological and risk management resources to operate a digital-only bank. It has also been necessary to construct a credible and viable business plan, supporting areas such as improved customer experience and financial inclusion.“Having said that, what I think is going to be different about Hong Kong relative to markets such as the UK is that the strongest new entrants will likely emerge with an established customer base. We will see platforms move laterally into financial services as well as traditional offline networks beginning to leverage their own networks for bank product distribution.”These players are learning lessons not just from growth-stage UK challengers but also from scale-stage technology ecosystems in mainland China and emergent super applications in Southeast Asia, says Lloyd.Aritra Chakravatry, founder and CEO of Project Imagine, believes that the biggest stumbling block for incumbents doing challenger banking revolves around people, incentives and organisational structures.Project Imagine is working to create a second-generation challenger banking and wealth management alternative from scratch. It has been authorised to provide eMoney services as well as distribute, manage and arrange investments for its clients. But is not a bank.“For instance, if the digital and technology functions of a bank sit outside the finance function and are integrated only at the senior management level, only so much digital-led innovation can take place at the firm. Instead, if technology is embedded in the finance function, it is more likely to offer innovative solutions,” Chakravatry tells the authors of the report.“There are also product silos — people in a bank looking after only their own product, rather than a customer segment. The people responsible for segments are usually more propositional, so they may talk about the bank’s brand and offerings. But they do not actually make product decisions, which means tailoring products to the customers’ needs is incredibly difficult.”On incentive structures, Chakravatry says most digital or technological transformations take four to six years to implement, which is quite a big bet with extensive risks for a big bank. In contrast, incentive structures in most banks tend to be driven by yearly performance. So, there is little incentive for individuals to undertake risky transformations at incumbent banks.Can incumbent-sponsored challenger banks replicate the kind of innovation done by standalone challenger banks? Chakravatry says when an incumbent bank provides its parent brand to its digital arm or virtual bank, or for branding and marketing purposes, it automatically generates interest from management to look over the shoulder of its challenger arm to monitor returns, risk propositions and so on.“This takes us back to the initial problem of organisational and incentive structures. However, if an incumbent bank can genuinely work at arm’s length, it is possible to replicate the challenger bank model and be equally revolutionary in those areas — with the added benefit of trust from the parent brand as leverage,” he adds.“It is a race to the finish right now. Will incumbents learn to decentralise decision-making and leverage trust without jeopardising decades of brand value, or will the challengers learn how to consistently deliver, stay funded and win trust while dealing with regulations and governance?“We will find out one way or another. But ultimately, the customer is likely to win.”",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/banking-rise-challenger-banks-asia,"2019-05-01 20:04:59"

CIMB-Principal Global Titans won the award for Best Equity Global (Provident) in the five-year category while CIMB-Principal Equity Income clinched the award for Best Equity Asia-Pacific ex-Japan (Provident) in the 10-year category.CEO Munirah Khairuddin says the fund house’s discretionary investing style and philosophy were pivotal to its wins. “We deploy different strategies in different cycles. For example, in a bear market, we look at things from a value investor’s point of view. In a bull market, we like to be more cautious and look at things from a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) perspective. In a late bull cycle, we start harvesting and get into a more defensive mode.“However, we do not compromise when it comes to risk management and corporate governance. Everything we do revolves around safeguarding our unitholders’ best interests.”She points out that the winning funds were able to generate outsized returns last year despite major challenges on the local and global fronts. In 2018, the fund management industry had to deal with the country’s 14th general election, slower economic growth in Asia as a result of the US-China trade tensions, and quantitative tightening in the US.“This led to earnings declining, fund outflows and weaker Asian currencies and stock markets. We became more defensive in our strategy and turned to value hunting in the later part of the year,” says Munirah.However, things are looking up this year as the reflationary efforts of China, pro-growth policies of Asean, tapering trade war rhetoric and US government shutdown, among other factors, point to a pickup in global growth.“Downside risks to global economic deterioration would be arrested. The low inflation environment is giving central banks more leeway to adopt dovish policies, with several countries in Asia possibly cutting interest rates this year,” says Munirah.She adds that the fund house is increasing its exposure to China, Indonesia and India. It is also taking a more balanced perspective when it comes to its funds, by strengthening the portfolios with growth and defensive sectors.“On a sector basis, we favour [those with] more cyclical exposure such as technology, consumer discretionary and industrial. We will take this opportunity to add quality large caps and alpha to the portfolios,” says Munirah.“We prefer big-cap government-linked companies with improving fundamentals and those with solid cash flows and dividends in sectors such as utilities and renewable energy, banks, oil and gas and industrials. Dividend income will provide a buffer and safety net in the event of unforeseen circumstances.”As for sectors to avoid, she says CIMB-Principal is cautious of export-oriented players for the time being. “[That is because] there are downside risks to the US dollar and disruption to the global supply chain amid the US-China trade negotiations.”In the light of current circumstances, she advises investors to take a more balanced approach by integrating defensive and value-hunting strategies. — By Pathma Subramaniam",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lipper-fund-awards-refinitiv-cimbprincipal-asset-management-bhd-won-two-fund-awards,"2019-05-01 20:05:00"

The monies recovered will be applied in accordance with section 201(7) of the CMSA, according to the posting the SC has put up on the website.The other three individuals found having taken advantage of insider information for trading purposes are former head of equity research at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd Terence Wong @ Huang Thar-Rearn, Abdul Radzim Abdul Rahman, who is the independent director of Amanah Investment, and Mohamed Radzif Mohamed Shamsudin.Wong also entered into a settlement with the SC amounting to RM573,150 for the same offence. He was noted to have acquired 800,000 MAS shares in July 2011. According to Reuters, CIMB was the adviser for the share swap deal.If not for the settlements, the SC would likely to have brought the matter to court for civil suits.    The insider trading is believed to have been linked to the proposed share swap deal that was unveiled in August 2011. MAS share price was on a roaster coaster ride then and its share price soared by as much as 28% in the days following the news. But the rally was short lived and the price then drifted lower.  To recap, in 2011, shareholders of MAS, AirAsia and AirAsia X Sdn Bhd (AAX) had proposed to enter into a share swap deal, originally intended to lend a helping hand to the loss-making national carrier.The agreement involved Khazanah Nasional Bhd (controlling shareholder of MAS) and Tune Air Sdn Bhd entering into a share swap agreement so that there will be cross-holding of shares resulting in Tune Air obtaining a 20.5% stake in then-listed MAS and Khazanah obtaining 10% in AirAsia.Kamarudin and Tan Sri Tony Fernandes are the owners of Tune Air.Both airlines also entered into a comprehensive collaboration framework. It was agreed that MAS was to be a full-service premium carrier, while AirAsia and AAX would be regional low-cost and medium-to-long haul low-cost carriers respectively.This was done in order to synergise the two Malaysian-based airlines and reduce competition against the national carrier.However, due to public outcry, the share swap deal was aborted eight months later.

213,"April 12, 2019 11:30 am +08",CIMB,"Growing champions: Transforming tech functions in Malaysian business","Technology is no longer an aspiration for many enterprises — it is a fundamental foundation of a modern business. As transformative digital connectivity makes way for a new wave of innovation characterised by disruptive artificial intelligence (AI), powerful robotics and the connected Internet of Things (IoT), it is time for every business to ask: Is your IT department ready for evolution?Malaysia Digital Economy Corp Sdn Bhd has made it clear that digital transformation in business will form the foundation of the nation’s future success. As Boston Consulting Group (BCG) highlights in its publication, Designing the Tech Function of the Future, it is time for your tech function to transform. Tech is everywhereTechnology is an increasingly ubiquitous and vital element of operations at every stage of an enterprise. But consider what this means for your IT department.Traditional IT departments are rarely compatible with the pace of technological evolution required in business today. They lack the niche skills and operational agility needed to respond to rapid shifts on business-critical timescales. Many are still operating in a very fragmented legacy landscape — built over decades, spanning multiple business units, making it even harder to adapt and change.This poses an existential challenge to the future of your IT department — do you transform the department to collaborate with business units in developing differentiating technologies or do you funnel IT into a silo, responsible only for mission-critical infrastructure?At BCG, we believe that for the majority of businesses faced with this question, the answer is clear — it is time to transform your IT department. Here are five design imperatives to consider when planning that change. 1) Develop product and service technologies close to the businessAgility is key in the new world of tech. Embedding a structure that positions your technology function as close as possible to customer products and services enables it to become a critical differentiator.Outsourcing core enterprise IT services frees up resources to provide agile and decentralised tech capabilities. Engineering teams focused on key business units can deliver faster iterations of offerings and shorter time to market, with strategic oversight channelled directly through the head of that business unit. Meanwhile, a team focused on central functions can deliver business-wide solutions and core infrastructure. 2) Integrate technology and businessIT has to move from an order-taker to a true business partner, influencing decisions and being a thought leader in helping to articulate the right proposition and ensure competitiveness.Thus, leaders need to support co-located, cross-functional teams that optimise collaboration and promote digital understanding. BCG’s experience has shown that an integrated and agile structure significantly speeds up time to market while improving product quality.Malaysia’s CIMB Bank offers a positive example of a company recognising this need to transform the relationship between technology and business, committing RM111 million to digital upskilling and development. This focus on evolving talent needs, alongside a revamped hiring practice that embeds an exposure to digital economies and start-ups, highlights the vital need for all organisations to understand and support the synergy of technology and operational success. 3) Build software engineering as a critical differentiatorAn IT evolution will necessitate a transformation of the skills available. Many IT organisations will need to move from generalist skills to build specialist skills in key disciplines such as software engineering, UI/UX design, DevOps, cloud and analytics to unlock new capabilities that impart a competitive advantage, while ensuring they keep strengthening core IT skills such as program managers and enterprise architecture.As such, it is critical that enterprises take a strategic and holistic view of the type of differentiated skills they want to build while considering outsourcing non-differentiating functions such as enterprise technologies, thus ensuring that internal resources are focused on the differentiating benefits that offer a competitive advantage. This change will require companies to develop mature digital sourcing skills to ensure they adopt the right technology solutions. 4) Ensure powerful governance and steering capabilitiesAn effective tech function requires powerful central governance and steering. That is a particularly crucial consideration in several key areas:•    Enterprise architecture management — ensure enterprise-wide interoperability and leverage scale for applications and infrastructure•    Data management and governance — securing data through its entire lifecycle with strong architecture and robust policies while enforcing the right data governance through ownership and stewardship•    Vendor and ecosystem management — move from transactional vendor management to a strategic partnered approach with a clear framework to support, develop and interact with different strategic vendors•    Security and cybersecurity — embed a business-wide approach to security aimed at minimising risk of attack while focusing on organisation, people and processes 5) Create a cloud-based digital foundationSimplified digital foundations are increasingly enabled by cloud-based vendors. While ensuring a cloud-first strategy is endorsed by the entire organisation, many enterprises are now adapting to the reality of managing a hybrid cloud environment — balancing the benefits of SaaS cloud-based applications and core data sensitive or legacy applications on a private cloud. Thus, it is critical that enterprises develop mature cloud skills and adopt an integrated end-to-end cloud management approach.A Malaysian telecommunications company’s accelerating shift towards the cloud was highlighted in a recently announced partnership with Microsoft, showing a clear illustration of this transition. As well as creating a more efficient cloud-based ecosystem for the company supported by the external know-how of Microsoft, the partnership is designed to enhance and grow internal talent for a true end-to-end approach. It is time to evolveThe IT department is experiencing a period of unprecedented change. It is up to you as a business to decide what that transformation might look like. Enterprises may choose to steer toward an agile, specialised and differentiated IT function in response to this changing environment. The alternative is for IT to operate in a business silo that focuses only on internal, mission-critical infrastructure.The importance of embracing this ethos of innovation and transformation is clearly demonstrated in the recent partnership between ride-hailing firm/digital unicorn Grab and Microsoft, combining the latter’s cloud-based opportunity and AI talent to enhance Grab’s business offering. Even a company built on innovative digital foundations like Grab recognises the need to support continuous transformation of its IT function.It is clear that technology is undergoing a continuous evolution. The question then is one of natural selection. Is your IT function positioned to evolve and support a future of digital transformation that will empower your business?Luc Grimond is partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/growing-champions-transforming-tech-functions-malaysian-business,"2019-05-01 20:05:02"

(April 11, RM5.06)
Maintain hold with a lower target price (TP) of RM5.35 from RM5.95: We expect near-term earnings growth to be unexciting as macro headwinds and cautious market sentiment persist. Revenue expansion is still a concern with normalising loans growth in Malaysia and Indonesia, thinning net interest margins (NIMs) arising from deposit-led competition in Malaysia, and shifts to a more conservative loan portfolio and still-uncertain non-interest income (NII) trends. Potential policy action may be an additional drag on earnings. That said, asset quality is on a better footing while credit costs should stay at healthier levels. Current guidance indicates some earnings growth weakness with a lower return on equity (ROE) of 9% to 9.5% and a cost-to-income ratio of 53% for financial year 2019 (FY19). Even with cheaper valuations, there may still be downside risks to earnings. 
Our FY19 to FY21 earnings forecasts are below the consensus, likely due to lower net interest income and non-interest income, but partially offset by lower provisions and overheads.A recovery in market activity arising from more optimistic market sentiment driving NII and better-than-expected NIM trends will help grow CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s earnings and share price. The group’s investment in Touch ‘n Go, while small, could serve as a rerating catalyst if the payment channel system starts dominating the payment space and rapidly expands over time in its effort to develop an e-wallet.We maintain “hold” with a lower TP of RM5.35. Our TP, which is based on the Gordon Growth Model, implies one time FY19 forecast (F) book value multiple. We have assumed a lower return on equity assumption of 9.7% ahead of weaker earnings traction and rolling over our valuation base to FY20F. Our other assumptions include a 5% long-term growth and 10.2% cost of equity.Key risks to our view include negative macro trends, soft market sentiment and a reversal of asset quality. Larger-than-expected NIM compression from greater competitive pressures and negative market sentiment impacting NII  and higher-than-expected credit costs are key risks. — AllianceDBS Research, April 11",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cimbs-credit-costs-seen-staying-healthy,"2019-05-01 20:05:03"

But, at this juncture, it is unclear if Felda can amend the terms of the LLA easily,” regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank Ivy Ng told The Edge Financial Daily when contacted.If Felda decides to terminate the LLA — which the White Paper on Felda yesterday revealed has been detrimental to the government agency — then it would have to compensate FGV in accordance with agreement’s terms and conditions, said Ng.“We are unable to estimate at this juncture the earnings impact for FGV in the event the LLA is terminated, as we are not able to ascertain the compensation amount.“However, we do think that if this happens, it is likely to be negative for FGV, as they will be losing one of their key earnings contributors as a large portion of past FGV earnings are derived from the estates it leases from Felda,” Ng added.According to FGV’s 2017 annual report, the group has 334,595ha of planted palm oil estates in Malaysia, and 12,519ha rubber estates. It also states that under the LLA it inked with Felda in November 2011, the leased land comprises both planted oil palm and rubber areas. Based on previous news reports, the LLA involves some 320,000ha.A local analyst, who declined to be named, concurred that the development is not good news for FGV. But one way for both to resolve the matter without affecting other shareholders too much would be to take FGV, which has been listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia since June 2012, private.“If the revision is to proceed, the easy way out would be privatisation. Take the company private before revising the terms so that minority shareholders can be out of the picture,” the analyst said.The analyst added that any upward revision of Felda’s profit-sharing portion from the existing 15% would translate into lesser profits for FGV shareholders.“As a shareholder, why would I want to agree to such terms? They could take back the land, but that makes little sense. FGV would be left with next to nothing since that would mean pretty much all of its Malaysian estates are subject to the agreement,” the analyst said.Interestingly, FGV’s share price rose yesterday amid active trade of 57.08 million shares. The stock rose as much as eight sen or 6.3% to RM1.34 within the first hour of trading, ahead of the tabling of the White Paper in the Dewan Rakyat yesterday.It eventually pared most of the earlier gains to finish the day at RM1.30 — still up four sen or 3.2% — and remained on Bursa Malaysia’s most active list throughout. On a year-to-date basis, the stock has risen about 82%.During the debate on Felda’s White Paper in Parliament yesterday, Minister of Economic Affairs Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali announced that Felda will be reviewing the LLA it has with FGV, to seek a better deal for all involved. Felda is FGV’s major shareholder with a 33.7% stake.“Felda is in discussion with the management of FGV to relook the terms of the agreements that have been agreed upon previously so that they will benefit all parties, particularly the settlers,” he said.During his speech, Mohamed Azmin said Felda should receive an annual payment of RM248 million plus a 15% share of plantation profit generated from the 99-year lease of its commercial land.Felda, however, only received an average of RM400 million a year from FGV, versus the minimum requirement of RM800 million per year to manage the plantations and to ensure the livelihood of settlers.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/feldas-land-lease-deal-review-seen-negative-fgv,"2019-05-01 20:05:04"

It required banks to make provisions in anticipation of future potential losses, as opposed to the previous practice under MFRS 139 of making provisions only when losses are incurred.“Last year was a transition year for banks. For the eight Malaysian banks, the rise in LLP ranged from as low as 34% to as high as about 80% on the first day of MFRS 9 adoption, or what is known as Day 1. But this was adjusted in the opening retained earnings and it did not hit their P&L (profit and loss). Any movement in the impairment allowances after that [Day 1], however, was reflected in the P&L.“Hence, investors cannot compare LLP in the banks’ P&L last year to 2017’s ... it was done on a different basis, and a chunk of it was taken in the retained earnings. This year, however, investors will be able to properly gauge the implications of MFRS 9 on a bank’s LLP,” says Elaine Ng, a partner at PwC, who advises lenders on MFRS 9 implementation.The Day 1 impact on LLP varied from bank to bank, depending on their loan composition, customer risk profiles and regulatory reserve buffers, among others.Last year, most banks reported sizeably lower provisions in their income statements, which helped lift profitability.CIMB Research, in a March 15 report, said it expects to see an increase in LLP for the banking sector this year. “We forecast a 14.9% increase in banks’ LLP in 2019 due to the lower base at end-2018, following an 18.6% decline in 2018.”The research house noted that 4Q2018’s LLP of RM390.5 million was the second-lowest since it first started compiling quarterly financial information on banks in 2000. As a matter of comparison, the LLP in 4Q2018 was only 30.4% of the average quarterly LLP of RM1.29 billion in the past eight quarters.“We believe that the low LLP of RM390.5 million in 4Q2018 is not sustainable going forward as this was pushed down by high write-backs and recoveries by most banks. We think that the sector’s LLP would revert back to the normalised level of between RM1 billion and RM1.1 billion in the next few quarters.”Analysts expect banks’ asset quality, which improved last year, to deteriorate slightly this year. The industry’s gross impaired loan (GIL) ratio declined to 1.45% as at end-December from 1.53% a year ago.“We project the industry’s GIL ratio to increase to 1.8% by end-December 2019. We think the risks to banks’ asset quality this year would come from the real-estate (for the exposures to developers) and oil and gas segments,” says CIMB Research. Volatility?Loans currently fall under any one of three stages under the banks’ respective expected credit loss (ECL) model under MFRS 9. Generally, loans that are performing and just originated fall under Stage 1 — where banks have to make provisions on the basis of projected losses over 12 months. Loans are constantly being assessed and will fall into Stage 2 if there is a deterioration in credit quality. Loans in Stage 3 are non-performing.For loans in Stages 2 and 3, the bank will have to recognise ECL over the expected life of the loan.“There could be some volatility in LLP this year, depending on the movement of the Stage 1, Stage 2 accounts,” says Ng. However, banks should not face too much volatility if their ECL models are robust, she adds.According to Ng, banks had focused mainly on the quantitative aspects of MFRS 9 last year. This year and the next, there is likely to be an increased focus on the governance aspects of their models.“I think we will be talking about model governance, model monitoring ... the whole governance process. And, also the ongoing validation and model refinement [as] there are a lot of assumptions built in the ECL model, so those are the things that banks will focus on this year.”Bank Negara Malaysia conducted a thematic review on the banks’ implementation of MFRS 9 last year to ascertain the adequacy of oversight and controls, methodology and models used to estimate ECL and system capabilities.“Overall, banking institutions transitioned reasonably smoothly to the new accounting standard, helped by their regulatory reserves which mitigated the impact of additional provisions. Banking institutions also generally demonstrated robust implementation approaches, although improvements in certain aspects of implementation were required for some,” the central bank said in its Financial Stability and Payment Systems Report 2018 released last week.In the report, Bank Negara also revealed that it had conducted a hypothetical portfolio evaluation (HPE) exercise in October 2018 to ascertain the degree of variability in banks’ provisioning levels. Under this exercise, nine banks were provided with a hypothetical portfolio of mortgage and corporate exposures and were required to estimate ECL provisions based on their internal models and methodologies.“[Bank Negara] is currently engaging with individual banking institutions and external auditors to finalise the assessment of the HPE exercise. Findings from both the thematic review and the HPE exercise will be used to determine whether a regulatory response is needed to ensure that the MFRS 9 is implemented in line with its intended outcomes,” it said.International Financial Reporting Standard 9 — MFRS 9 is the Malaysia equivalent — was designed to address the “too little too late” criticism that followed the 2008/09 global financial crisis that banks were not able to account for losses until they were incurred, even when it was apparent that they were coming.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/eye-provisions-after-mfrs-9,"2019-05-01 20:05:05"

226,"April 08, 2019 15:00 pm +08",CIMB,"The State of the Nation: Bank Negara’s monetary policy stance remains a wild card for now ","IF Bank Negara Malaysia governor Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus was keen to join other central banks such as the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand at the dovish party, she definitely did not let it show.At a press conference in conjunction with the release of Bank Negara’s 2018 Annual Report last week, Shamsiah dropped absolutely no hints that a cut to the overnight policy rate (OPR) was imminent.What the governor did say, however, was that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will return with a data-dependent decision once it has reviewed a confluence of factors in deciding whether to adjust the OPR.“We will look at both external and internal developments, at how those developments affect the domestic economy, inflation and financing conditions,” she says.Meanwhile, Socio-Economic Research Centre (SERC) executive director Lee Heng Guie says  the probability of a rate cut will depend on how the Malaysian economy responds to the attendant risks, and the first quarter’s gross domestic product (GDP) performance.“High-frequency data for global and domestic conditions suggests a moderate pace of expansion ahead. There is an even chance that Bank Negara would deliver a rate cut in May’s MPC meeting given the considerable external uncertainties that could undermine consumer and business sentiments, as well as economic growth,” he tells The Edge.UOB Malaysia senior economist Julia Goh believes Bank Negara has more flexibility now to loosen monetary policy to support growth since there is no expectation of a rate hike from the US Federal Reserve this year.“In view of higher downside risks to growth, we expect a 25bp cut in the overnight policy rate to 3% as early as May,” she says in a note to investors last week.Similar sentiments were echoed by CIMB Research economist Michelle Chia, who says current macro conditions present an opportune window for Bank Negara to adopt easier monetary policies that guard against downside growth risks.“As such, we revise our end-2019 OPR forecast from 3.25% (no hike) to 3% (25bp cut), which still offers Bank Negara sufficient policy buffer for future deployment. The timing of such a cut is, admittedly, a moving target.“Bank Negara officials noted that monetary policy will be data dependent, suggesting that a loss of vigour in the economy and financial markets ahead of the next MPC meeting on May 7 could prompt policymakers to spring into action,” she writes in a note to clients.Mizuho Bank Singapore head of economics and strategy Vishnu Varathan assigns a 40% probability to a rate cut at the next meeting.“A prime reason for a pause eclipsing the case for a cut is that  Bank Negara will want to observe more data points, though as pointed out, the balance of risks is to the downside.“What’s more, as pointed out when it hiked by 25bps in January last year, that was not tightening per se, but a calibration, which still left policy setting accommodative.“That said, all else being equal, the global downturn conspiring with subdued inflation sets the stage for a rate cut to gently navigate the economy through the headwinds,” he says.However, some quarters believe that Bank Negara would likely stay put on the key rate.Barclays Bank regional economist Brian Tan says the language in the annual report continues to suggest the central bank has little intention of cutting its policy rate in the near term.“In particular, Bank Negara emphasised that it still expects both economic growth momentum and underlying consumer price index inflation to sustain. The annual report also noted that while the risks of financial imbalances are expected to remain contained, the Monetary Policy Committee is cognisant of challenges emanating from potential continued volatility in global capital flows,” he tells The Edge.He adds that in its financial stability and payment systems report, the central bank also still sounded hawkish on financial stability risks, stressing that “we cannot afford to be complacent”.“Our base case remains for no rate cuts because we think a recovery in commodity-related activities would support our forecast for broadly stable GDP growth of 4.5% this year, moderating from 4.7% in 2018. If GDP growth were to slow closer to 4.3%, the bottom of Bank Negara’s 2019 forecast range, we believe rate cuts would come into focus,” says Tan.Bank Negara is expecting economic growth to come in between 4.3% and 4.8% this year, lower than the Ministry of Finance’s earlier forecast of 4.9%. This was due to the downward revision in global growth, which was revised from 3.7% to 3.5%, Shamsiah explains.Lee says it is clear that the balance of risks is tilted towards the downside as indicated in the revision of this year’s GDP estimate. “The materialisation of downside risks from unresolved trade tensions, heightened uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, and prolonged weakness in the commodity-related sectors could further weigh down on growth,” he says.He adds that while domestic demand continues to be the key driver of economic growth, the estimated domestic demand growth of 4.4% this year is 1.2 percentage points lower than 5.6% last year, with private consumption growth moderating and private investment pacing moderately.“Hence, a pullback in consumption and investment growth could tilt the GDP growth lower. In addition, banking system loan applications moderated towards end-2018,” Lee says. Not a growth-targeting central bankAt the press conference, Shamsiah also made an interesting observation about the role of the central bank in stimulating economic growth.“It does not mean that whenever there is an adjustment to the OPR, growth is going to be stronger or slower; we are not a growth-targeting central bank,” she says.Mizuho’s Vishnu concurs with the governor’s statement targeting central banks.“Bank Negara is implicitly an inflation-targeting central bank. But above all, and most importantly, [the central bank] sets out to achieve monetary and financial stability for sustained growth.“The emphasis is on stability and sustainability rather than blindly setting out to achieve a hard growth target,” he says.Tan, who also agrees with the governor’s statement, says historically, Bank Negara has never been purely focused on economic growth as its monetary policy had also accounted for price stability and financial stability.“A single-minded focus on boosting growth could drive inflation up and fuel a build-up of financial imbalances,” he says. Does Malaysia need a rate cut?Year to date, the ringgit has appreciated 1.2% against the US dollar to 4.0835 last Friday. A general perception is that a rate cut could depreciate the ringgit. However, Vishnu says this is not necessarily the case.“Interest rate differentials suggest that, all else being equal, a rate cut should soften the ringgit. But this is often too simplistic and dynamics are far more complex.“The fact is oil prices have a much larger bearing on the ringgit. Also, a Fed that is turning dovish more quickly — as are regional central banks — could also diminish the rate cut impact on the ringgit,” he says.The country’s household debt to GDP level remains elevated, though it moderated slightly to 83% last year from 83.8% in 2017.“A small step in interest rate cut helps to boost consumer and investor sentiment as it provides some relief on debt servicing and lowers lending cost for both consumers and businesses,” says SERC’s Lee.Meanwhile, reports have emerged on potential deflation concerns for Malaysia, given two consecutive months of price contraction. Shamsiah , however, strongly disagreed with this notion.“The data speaks for itself. If you look at the CPI basket, more than half of the items are experiencing price increases, so that does not mean a broad-based decline or deflation.“So when you talk about deflation, you are talking about a broad-based decline in prices, such that the demand conditions have collapsed and firms would have to lower prices in order to attract demand. We are not seeing that kind of conditions.“The negative inflation is being driven by the [drop] in fuel prices,” she says.Bank Negara is expecting headline inflation to average between 0.7% and 1.7% this year. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/state-nation-bank-negaras-monetary-policy-stance-remains-wild-card-now,"2019-05-01 20:05:10"
227,"April 08, 2019 14:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Lead Story: Value emerges after panic selling over fears of a US recession","LAST week, a torrent of recession- themed news reports, coupled with the US’ inverted yield curve — a huge development according to Bloomberg — prompted a swift retreat from the markets. The FBM KLCI was not spared, crumbling to its worst week of the year so far.But on the bright side, analysts say that the heavy selldown has resulted in value emerging.“It is true that the inverted yield curve has triggered some concern over a potential recession in the US, but we do not think that alone is conclusive in predicting a recession. We think that the market selldown amid the uncertainty could create buying opportunities for some traders as well as long-term investors as share prices [have] come down to attractive values,” says Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau.Even before the US Treasury yield curve inverted, Maybank IB Research head of research Wong Chew Hann was advocating Malaysian equities following a sharp decline in the market in March. The potential was highlighted at the recent Invest Malaysia 2019 Capital Market Forum. “With the FBM KLCI having fallen so much, there is definitely value for investors,” she tells The Edge, noting that some foreign funds look at the stock market from a top-down approach while others prefer a bottom-up approach.“For those who wanted to exit Malaysia, I think they would already have done so by the end of last year. In February, there was selling but it was likely due to profit-taking after January’s net buy into the equity market.“What has happened recently [in March] is likely to do with the rebalancing of the MSCI Index, where China has a higher allocation. We see that foreign funds are also selling in Thailand,” Wong observes.Affin Hwang Asset Management portfolio manager Lim Chia Wei believes it is too early to conclude that a US recession is imminent. “The US yield curve inversion (10-year against 3-month) is a useful indicator to measure recessionary risk. However, there are cases when yield curve inversion is temporary and does not lead to a recession. It is important to monitor if the curve inverts further or reverts to a positive curve in the coming months.“Apart from the yield curve, the US Leading Economic Index (LEI) is also a good indicator of recessionary risk. The US LEI is healthy and is not indicating an imminent recession. It is best to look at various indicators as a whole instead of looking at each indicator in isolation. At the moment, it is not conclusive that a US recession is imminent in the next 12 months.”He also points to the pickup in China’s credit impulse amid signs of economic stabilisation and green shoots of recovery. “Optimistically, if China’s stimulus takes form and if there is a resolution to the trade dispute, global trade could then pick up and lead to improved growth.“We believe that the majority of stock market participants are reading the yield curve as an indication of higher recessionary risk, but that is not conclusive by itself. After the knee-jerk decline on March 22, stock markets have recovered in the following days.”He says Affin Hwang AM will continue to monitor recessionary risks closely and reposition as the global environment shifts. “Global growth has slowed down and in such an environment, sectors with structural-growth stories that can deliver above-average returns tend to do well despite higher valuations. These include the internet and software sectors, which we like.”CIMB Investment Bank Bhd head of Malaysia research and regional head of agribusiness research, Ivy Ng, also shrugged off talk of a US recession. “We are not expecting a recession in the US. While US gross domestic product growth is slowing in line with expectations as fiscal stimulus fades, steady demand in the private sector, positive labour market developments and, more recently, a more dovish and patient US Federal Reserve are likely to provide support for continued economic expansion,” she says.She adds that the bank’s preferred sectors include glove manufacturers, oil and gas (O&G) and healthcare, as well as companies that have defensive earnings and good dividend yields.“In our strategy report, we provided six investment themes for 2019, which are M&A (mergers and acquisitions), the US-China trade war, GLC (government-linked companies) reform, companies that offer defensive earnings, companies that offer high dividend yields and stocks that may have been oversold,” Ng says, adding that the bank is “underweight” on construction and building materials at the moment.The small cap space is also attractive in terms of valuations owing to the small-cap index’s underperformance against the FBM KLCI last year — the potential exploited by savvy investors who jumped in late last year or earlier this year to boost the small-cap index.What is holding investors back?Maybank IB Research’s Wong believes investors may be cautious due to subdued earnings growth as well as policy risks.“As for those who look to take positions in the bigger cap stocks or those within the FBM KLCI, I think there are two main issues. First is the subdued corporate earnings growth. In fact, for our research universe, market earnings for last year were actually on a decline. Growth was negative.“It [earnings growth for the market] was flattish in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and we saw a bit of a rebound in 2017 at about 6% to 7% but it fell back into negative territory last year.”Foreign investors also want policy stability, which to them is still lacking even though the Pakatan Harapan government has been in power for nearly a year.“We saw what happened last year to the telco sector, construction and even casino operators. I think there are a few more policy decisions pending that the government will need to sort out this year, and that people are watching closely to see how they unfold,” Wong says.Maybank IB Research is “overweight” on the O&G sector.Wong says year to date, the crude oil price has rebounded and the bank expects it to stay at an average of US$65 per barrel for the year. Moreover, the Petronas Activity Outlook report for 2019-2021 indicates that activities in various O&G segments are expected to be better, which should benefit service providers.There are a few stock picks in the automotive sector that she likes as some new model launches will help drive demand. Resetting foreign exchange rates with overseas dealers could also enlarge margins.While construction stocks may have seen some recovery, Wong cautions investors to be careful of slimmer margins even if mega-infrastructure projects, such as the East Coast Rail Link ultimately get the go-ahead.“If the value [of the project] is lower, I think the margins will come off as well. If you actually win a job with very thin margins, your margin for error is very small. If anything goes wrong, it can be negative for the companies. Whether to take positions, I think investors should be more cautious moving forward,” she says. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-value-emerges-after-panic-selling-over-fears-us-recession,"2019-05-01 20:05:10"

Both segments contribute equally to earnings at present, said its country head Raymond Lew.Having enjoyed a compound annual growth rate of 18% over the past six years, Sun Life Malaysia saw its premium growth rate cut by more than half to 9% last year, from 22% in 2017. The drastic decline was attributed to dampened consumer sentiment after the 14th general election (GE14) in May 2018.The impact was evident in the higher rate of lapsation of policies because of insufficient funds — particularly among the bottom 40% group — as well as a decline in its bancassurance business owing to fewer mortgage or loan applications.“Last year was a particularly challenging year. But we are seeing momentum returning since March. If we keep a sharp focus on our execution this year, we will be able to overcome some of the challenges [faced previously].“We are looking at a 23% growth in premiums, and to revive our momentum [to that of] before the GE14,” Lew told The Edge Financial Daily in an interview, adding that the company is aming for further organic and inorganic growth.According to Lew, the company is focusing on the execution of its products this year, after spending the past few years on innovation.Last year, Sun Life Malaysia’s takaful unit launched Takaful Mulia through its partner CIMB Islamic Bank, following the success of its first universal life haj takaful product, Takaful Suria, introduced in 2015.To date, these first-in-market products boast some 40,000 clients. Combined with its conventional life insurance business, Sun Life Malaysia has captured 4.2% of the domestic market share, more than double its 1.7% stake in 2013, when it was first incepted.Its total client base stands at 1.8 million, with a projected 10% to 15% growth to come based on the number of clients its industry partners have, said Lew in reference to its partnerships with industry players such as CIMB, Kuwait Finance House, Bank Rakyat and Al Rajhi Bank, among others.“What we need to do now is to find the best and most cost-effective way to reach out to [potential] clients and engage with them.“The takaful segment still has huge potential with its penetration rate at about 30% now. Judging from the country’s demographics, this is the blue ocean where we want to expand. We need to position ourselves properly to seize the opportunity.”He observed that areas on the outskirts, such as along the East Coast, are particularly underserved due to a lack of easy accessibility and awareness.“These are the segments that agents find less cost-efficient to service. And that is why we need to find the right channel and we have done quite a lot on this front,” said Lew, who is also the chief executive officer and president of Sun Life Malaysia.With this in mind, the insurer launched the country’s first “pay-as-you-go” micro-protection product last year, dubbed GOLIFE, distributed through the mobile application platform of telecommunications service provider U Mobile.The mobile-based micro-insurance product allows U Mobile users to subscribe to affordable monthly plans with a fee of RM5 or RM10.“Since insurance products are not always unique as they are all regulated, it is important we position ourselves and customise our products in accordance with our clients’ needs and affordability, as well as accessibility to ensure we stay relevant.“U Mobile has innovative strategies we found we can align with. Going forward, being part of Khazanah [Nasional Bhd], we certainly want to talk to Axiata as well,” Lew shared.Besides insurtech, he acknowledged the significance of digitisation in the use of artificial intelligence as a tool to enhance client experience. This can be in the form of servicing or communication, but less so for distribution, he said, adding that in line with the closure of physical bank branches in the era of digital banking, insurance players such as Sun Life Malaysia must reinvent promotion strategies to tap the banks’ client pool.“But I must say that insurance is still a product that has to be sold, rather than to be bought,” said Lew. “We are very strong in telemarketing and direct marketing, and will continue to grow our network further.”An investment holding company wholly-owned by Khazanah, Sun Life Malaysia is a joint venture between Sun Life Financial Inc and Avicennia Capital Sdn Bhd, specialising in conventional life insurance and family takaful.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/sun-life-malaysia-sees-blue-ocean-takaful,"2019-05-01 20:05:11"
231,"April 08, 2019 09:04 am +08",CIMB,"Five hurdles Bursa Malaysia has to overcome this year","KUALA LUMPUR: As corporate earnings failed to meet expectations in the first quarter of 2019 (1Q19), the FBM KLCI continued underperforming other Asian markets. It fell to a two-year low of 1,628.66 points last Monday and barely recovered to 1,641.81 points at last Friday’s close.Most market observers contacted by The Edge Financial Daily opined that there is limited room for upside in the benchmark index, especially considering the lack of strong growth catalysts.Here are five hurdles that may continue to weigh on the KLCI: 1. Sluggish domestic corporate earnings growthMalacca Securities Sdn Bhd senior analyst Kenneth Leong said the main reason the benchmark index’s performance has been  lacklustre and lagging behind those of neighbouring countries is its unattractive valuations amid sluggish corporate earnings growth.“The key index is trading at a prospective price-earnings ratio (PER) of 16.3 times and 15.3 times for 2019 and 2020 respectively — slightly below the five-year average of 17.4 times, implying limited upside,” Leong added.On the other hand, regional peers, most of which saw their indexes take a beating last year, have PERs that are trading at a more appealing level. (see table)For instance, as at end last year, the Shanghai Composite traded at a PER of 11.8 times compared with its historical five-year average of 15.8 times. Likewise, the Hang Seng Index’s PER was 10.2 times versus its historical five-year average of 12 times, Leong noted.“Should earnings growth continue to disappoint, the key index is likely to head south with the immediate support located towards the 1,630 level. Should that level fail to hold, the next key support is pegged at the 1,600 level. Unless there are any earnings surprises, any gains are capped towards the 1,700-1,730 levels,” said Leong.Meanwhile, RHB Research head of research Alexander Chia agreed that the forward PER of 16.9 times for the KLCI is already high compared with its regional peers.Together with tepid earnings growth prospect this year — RHB estimates a growth of 0.7% versus the consensus forecast of 3% to 5% — Chia expects the trading market going forward to lack strong growth catalysts.As such, he foresees the trading band could drop to between 1,600 and 1,750, from 1,650-1,850. 2. Unfavourable domestic economic factorsA potential interest rate cut by Bank Negara Malaysia has already impacted the KLCI, as seen in the selldown among heavyweight banking stocks.“More than 50% of the FBM KLCI decline is attributed to the fall in prices of Public Bank Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), over concerns of the effects [of a rate cut] on their future incomes,” highlighted Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman, head of MIDF Research.While most analysts have said that the rate cut would not severely impact banks’ earnings, credit rating firm Moody’s Investors Services said such a move would “definitely lead to margin pressure” on local banks.However, other sectors could benefit from the increase in liquidity and economic boost from the cut in the overnight policy rate. The key rate, which was raised by 25 basis points in January 2018 to 3.25%, was last reduced in July 2016, also by 25 basis points.Separately, an appreciation in the ringgit has hurt exporters, including KLCI component stocks Top Glove Corp Bhd and Hartalega Holdings Bhd.These stocks have also been battered over issues with foreign workers and a looming oversupply of rubber gloves due to a mismatch between capacity expansion and demand growth, highlighted Malacca Securities’ Leong. 3. Lack of clarity on government policiesThe government’s best efforts notwithstanding, investors still seem to be regarding their commitment to clarity and transparency as just a lot of rhetoric.“Domestically, investors are still looking for clarity on growth policies. [Setting a] 4.9% gross domestic product growth target is okay...but they are looking for policies to help corporate Malaysia,” said RHB’s Chia.“For example, the Council of Eminent Persons report is not being made public. As for the National Economic Action Council — we haven’t heard of any specific recommendations from them,” he added.The construction sector is one of the key areas where investors are hoping for more positive news flow to boost the nation’s economy, said Rakuten Trade research head Kenny Yee.“Though the construction sector has done well so far, we expect there are more to come with an abundance of projects coming on stream to a tune of RM300 billion,” he said.Succession planning, interestingly, remains another large concern for investors, despite Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad repeatedly saying that Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will be his successor, if that is the people’s choice.Chia said India and Indonesia’s markets took some 18 months to bounce back after their 2014 elections, while Malaysia, he noted, faces the added uncertainty over its future leadership. 4. External headwindsUncertainties surrounding the US-China trade deal and the UK’s decision to exit the European Union (EU) have continued to drag on market sentiment.While there has been some optimism that the world’s two largest economies can reach a deal to end their destabilising dispute, progress of the ongoing trade talks has been slow.After the March 1 deadline for reaching a deal with China expired, both countries are now aiming to reach a trade deal in the next four weeks, while US President Donald Trump has warned it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without an agreement.“There has been some progress, but nothing concrete has been signed, except maybe China has been buying US soy in the past month. This has put pressure on global economic growth,” said MIDF’s Mohd Redza.On the Brexit issue, he said signs are pointing to a further delay and this development has affected market sentiment, especially with the EU not doing so well economically, which has further pressured its ability to raise interest rates. 5. Pressure on palm oilWhile the benchmark palm oil contract for June delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was up 1.3% at RM2,204 a tonne last Thursday, the benchmark palm oil price averaged RM2,124 a tonne in March, the lowest in three months.MIDF’s Mohd Redza said palm oil inventory remains high at above three million tonnes amid concerns over EU’s decision to phase out the use of palm oil in biofuels, which has been pressuring plantation stocks.Malaysian palm oil stockpile hit its highest in nearly two decades in December at 3.22 million tonnes. In February, it eased to 3.05 million tonnes, but it was 1.3% higher than the previous month.Last Friday, the ministry of primary industries said in a statement that Malaysian and Indonesian officials will visit Brussels today and tomorrow to voice their objection to the EU’s delegated act that paves the way to the phasing out of the use of palm oil in biofuels. The mission was agreed at end-February at the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries meeting in Jakarta.“Malaysia urges the European Union to provide equitable treatment across all oil crops biofuels and bioliquids in line with the World Trade Organization non-discriminative principles. Malaysia will continue to overcome disruptive and discriminatory practices on suppressing palm oil trade,” the statement read.Prior to last Friday’s announcement, both Malaysia and Indonesia, two major global palm oil suppliers that collectively supply about 85% of global palm oil, had warned they were ready to retaliate against what they termed the EU’s act of discrimination against the edible oil.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/five-hurdles-bursa-malaysia-has-overcome-year,"2019-05-01 20:05:12"

This increases palm oil use for food and cooking.Importers typically stock up on the edible oil one to two months ahead of the festival.Palm oil shipments from Malaysia are pegged to come in at 1.63 million tonnes for March, a 23.4% rise from the previous month. The monthly gain, if confirmed by official data, would be the strongest in six months.""The low crude palm oil price environment triggered major restocking — buyers realized CPO prices were undervalued versus other edible oils,"" said William Simadiputra, an analyst at DBS Vickers Securities.Benchmark palm oil prices averaged RM2,124 a tonne in March, the lowest in three months.Output in March is expected to have risen for its first gain after four months of declines.

As a result, Vizione did not suffer any financial impact,"" it said in a statement.When contacted, a spokesperson for Vizione added that the deposit was a “tender deposit” for Package 1 of the project. Vizione, meanwhile, has already secured Package 2 of the project worth RM815 million from CZC last year, via a 50:50 joint venture with Vertice Bhd. The portion involves the construction of a 5.7-kilometre bypass from Bandar Baru Ayer Itam to Lebuhraya Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu. Vertice, formerly known as Voir Holdings Bhd, has a 13.2% stake in CZC.Vizione’s statement was in response to news reports about a businessman being charged for having deceived CZC into paying RM19 million to him, in exchange for a graft probe on the PMI project to be closed.The businessman, G. Gnanaraja, pleaded not guilty in the Sessions Court on Wednesday, after being charged with three counts of deceiving a managing director (MD) to pay him RM19 million in three transactions between July and August 2017.

CIMB Investment Bank Bhd (CIMB IB) sent representatives in its capacity as financial adviser to the government in order to provide feedback on the meeting to the Ministry of Finance (MoF).The main issue the investors raised was the methodology to be used to determine the valuation of the highway concessionaires. They were also concerned about the possible impact on the capital market if the parties involved failed to agree on a fair valuation.A source told The Edge that a representative of an investment bank that holds Gamuda’s securities said there appears to be a general lack of understanding of the capital market by the current government. “The banker expressed concern about the impact on the capital market if the government could not adhere to its rules and the sanctity of contracts. He said that if the government did not adhere to the rules of the capital market, the country’s risk premium would increase.”On the valuation methodology, most of the investors at the meeting believed that the discounted cash flow (DCF) method should be applied to the non-listed highway concessionaires owned by Gamuda. These include Syarikat Mengurus Air Banjir dan Terowong Sdn Bhd (SMART), Syarikat Penyuraian Trafik KL Barat Sdn Bhd (SPRINT) and Kesas Sdn Bhd.Another source tells The Edge that the investors do not want any departure from the DCF method, as doing so would set a bad precedent for future acquisitions.Even if the DCF model is adopted, the discount rate is another variable that may cause a heated debate. Should the discount be the yield of Malaysian Government Securities or the fixed deposit rate?Furthermore,  the estimated traffic volume growth is a key determinant of the cash flow from tolls.Meanwhile, the investors agreed that Lingkaran Trans Kota Sdn Bhd (LITRAK) should be valued based on its parent’s market value. LITRAK is a subsidiary of Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd, which is listed on Bursa Malaysia. Gamuda is the largest shareholder in Lingkaran Trans Kota with a 43.57% stake.However, the sources say that one of the investors raised the issue of the appropriate cut-off date in the calculation of the volume-weighted average market price (VWAMP) in determining LITRAK’s valuation, since its parent’s share price had fallen considerably after the general election (GE14) last year. Since May 14 last year, the counter had declined 19% to last Friday’s close of RM4.33. During the year before GE14, the highway concessionaire was trading at RM5.37 to RM6.15.“Some investors argued that the VWAMP prior to GE14 should be used. However, this is not the normal practice. Usually, the VWAMP of six months prior to the announcement of the acquisition is used to value a listed company,” says one of the sources.“Anyway, investment in quoted shares comes with its own risks, and fluctuations in market prices is one of them,” says another.The question of expropriation was also raised during the meeting, the sources say, because based on the provisions of the Concession Agreements, the government has the legal right to expropriate the highways.However, the source says that CIMB IB, which is advising the government, is committed to ensuring that this does not happen as it recognises the importance of a fair offer.“The interests of the shareholders and the government must be aligned. One of the investors even said outright that her institution would walk away from the deal if the offer was unfair,” says a source.According to the sources, questions were asked about how the government came up with the figure of RM5.3 billion in savings if the highways are nationalised. The investors wanted to know whether the projected savings would be included in the valuation.CIMB IB is said to have clarified that the RM5.3 billion represents scheduled toll hikes and should be included in the valuation, and that any savings by the government after the acquisition takes place should not affect the DCF.CIMB IB has clarified that it did not commit to ensuring the manner in which the acquisitions of the highways would take place. It also says it did not represent that the RM5.3 billion in question should be included in the valuation of the highways.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/gamudas-investors-discuss-nationalisation-its-highways,"2019-05-01 20:05:15"

We are doing a lot of engagement. I’m sending the secretariat to work with MITI and the Malaysian team,” Rebecca told Bernama at the end of the ASEAN Roundtable Series here today where she was one of the panellists.The CIMB ASEAN Research Institute (CARI) and ASEAN Business Club in partnership with the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) today hosted the ASEAN Roundtable Series titled “Future of Asean Trade: Tackling Non-Tariff Barriers in the New Trade Order”.Rebecca said the APEC secretariat will travel north this month to hold workshops and look at different aspect of organising the regional forum related to, among others, communications strategy and logistics.“We are working very closely with Malaysian team…even on the themes for the Malaysia year. It is a very important year… Malaysia year 2020,” said Rebecca, the former Malaysia’s MITI secretary-general.The current APEC host is Chile.Updating on the Bogor Goals, one of APEC’s flagship initiatives, Rebecca said: “We are working on the post-Bogor Goals now. There will be some works that will be handed (over) to officials at the end of the year for the leaders. But the fine tuning and strategic plan will be done during Malaysia year.”In 1994, after APEC leaders met in Indonesia, in the town of Bogor, where they announced the adoption of “the long-term goal of free and open trade and investment in Asia Pacific” and set a deadline “no later than 2020.”The collective aspiration has been called the Bogor Goals ever since.On whether any announcement related to the Bogor Goals will be made during the Malaysia year, Rebecca said: “Yes, of course. That is part of the deal. What will APEC do post 2020? ...ya, that is Malaysia deliverable.”On the latest percentage of average tariff, Rebecca asserted: “APEC doesn’t do binding tariff like ASEAN.“But we have a general statement about reducing tariff and that was part of Bogor Goals already. So trade liberalisation in terms of tariff is almost done. So, what else do you need to do (going forward). Even at APEC, we will be looking at NTMs (non-tariff measures) …looking at tariff facilitation measures.. those things are part of the package for APEC going forward.”Rebecca noted that some aspects of the Bogor Goals that are not completed will be carried forward to the Malaysia year.According to the 2018 Bogor Goals Progress Report, tariffs have fallen, more free-trade agreements are improving market access conditions for goods and services, and custom reforms are making it easier, cheaper and faster to trade.However, the assessment also shows a need for improvement in other areas, namely tariffs in agriculture which are still higher than those imposed on non-agricultural products, NTMs that are affecting trade have accumulated in recent years, and sectoral restrictions for foreign companies in services and investment.The Bogor Goals have inspired member economies to pursue individual and collective action to reduce barriers to trade and investment, of which, one result was a region-wide drop in average tariffs from 17 percent in the 1980s to around 5.0 per cent today.The ASEAN Roundtable Series was also attended by CARI chairman Tan Sri Dr Mohd Munir Abdul Majid and RSIS executive deputy chairman Ong Keng Yong.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/groundwork-laid-apec-2020s-malaysia-year-%E2%80%94-rebecca,"2019-05-01 20:05:18"
242,"April 02, 2019 11:30 am +08",CIMB,"Fintech: Malaysian banks getting ready for more fintech","Malaysian banks are keeping up with some of the global trends in financial technology (fintech), with developments in payments, compliance and lending, says Alvin Gan (picture), executive director of management consulting for IT-enabled transformation at KPMG in Malaysia.KPMG’s global office recently released its annual predictions for fintech, identifying trends such as consolidation in mature areas like payments and lending, global expansion of challenger banks, increased levels of blockchain adoption, the rise of regulatory technology (regtech) and insurance technology (insurtech) in Asia and the growing awareness of open-banking regulations.More collaboration between fintech players and banks is to be expected in Asia, particularly in areas such as know-your-customer (KYC) processes, anti-money laundering and digital identity management, including facial and voice recognition.Several local banks are already exploring some of these trends. For instance, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd is collaborating with Ripple for blockchain-enabled remittance services while HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd is pushing for a blockchain-based trade finance platform, according to reports. CIMB Group was the first to receive regulatory sandbox approval from Bank Negara Malaysia to implement e-KYC in 2017.Payments have become a relatively crowded space in Malaysia. Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) was the first to launch its digital wallet in 2016 and its QRPay option can be easily spotted at many retail shops. Now, many fintech start-ups are also competing to offer these services.“The payments space is so crowded already. The majority of fintech companies are in payments,” says Gan.Compliance and lending are also areas that Malaysian banks are looking to tap when it comes to fintech solutions, although they are mostly at the proof-of-concept (POC) stage, says Gan.Regtech is gaining popularity among local banks as financial institutions hope to use these solutions, which incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, to improve their processes.“Bank Negara has come up with a lot of regulatory requirements and banks are trying to comply by using technology. The banks have a list of all the regulations and when they go through it for compliance, it is still done using email and Excel spreadsheets. So, the probability of something going wrong is quite high,” says Gan.In the lending space, some banks are hoping to use AI for quicker search functions. “Customer loans is another area where we are seeing POCs. For example, if a bank wants to know the amount of loans it holds or how many contracts contain certain terms, they can use AI-powered tools to search rather than scan each document manually,” says Gan.An example of a local bank working with a fintech start-up in the lending space is RHB Bank Bhd, which began working with RinggitPlus in 2017 to enable loan applications online with the use of a chatbot.Wealth management is another area that local banks are exploring in terms of fintech solutions, says Gan. For instance, one could see the incorporation of robo-advisors in a private banking setting.Alternative data scoring is also something financial players are looking at. For example, Malaysia’s largest credit reporting agency, CTOS Data Systems Sdn Bhd, signed a partnership with LenddoEFL, a fintech player that specialises in alternative data scoring, last November to enable this function.Some consumers may hope to see more fintech innovations from their banks at a quicker pace, but changing these legacy systems can be challenging, says Gan. Banks are still going through a learning curve to roll out these changes, even though they understand the need to do so.“The momentum is ongoing, but a lot of banks still face challenges. We did a global survey last year and found that 43% of the banks surveyed had a digital plan but only 19% felt that it was effective. There is a discrepancy here. Although they have a [digitalisation] plan in place, only 19% believe it will actually advance their business,” says Gan.This is why digitalisation needs to be on the CEO or board’s agenda for it to succeed, he adds. It has to be done with the collaboration of the business and technology leaders of the company.“A lot of banks are focused on the day-to-day stuff, but who is looking at the fintech segment? That is why we are seeing a lot of banks appoint their own chief digital officers. If you have your chief investment officer and chief digital officer playing the same role, it will be difficult. So, that is the direction a lot of banks are trying to take,” says Gan.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fintech-malaysian-banks-getting-ready-more-fintech,"2019-05-01 20:05:18"
243,"April 02, 2019 11:11 am +08",CIMB,"Loan growth for banks expected to be at 5% for 2019","Banking sector
Maintain neutral: Bank Negara Malaysia reports that total loans and advances softened to 5% year-on-year (y-o-y) (-0.2% month-on-month [m-o-m]) in February 2019 versus a growth of 5.5% a month ago.The yearly increase in demand for credit was mostly underpinned by the consumer segment, which widened by 5.4% y-o-y.Compared to the growth of 5.7% in January 2019, consumer loans eased sequentially. Accounting for some 60% of total consumer loans, the slowdown was largely due to residential mortgages, which rose at a softer pace of 7.1% y-o-y (+0.3% m-o-m).This was followed by personal loans (+7.2% y-o-y, -0.1% m-o-m) and drawdowns for the purchase of securities 6.2% y-o-y (-0.3% m-o-m).Loans for passenger car purchase were lacklustre, slipping 0.6% y-o-y and -0.3% m-o-m.The advances for credit cards paced up, rising 2% y-o-y during the month.The momentum for business loans also weakened. While we estimate that business loans were largely supported by the small and medium enterprise segment (+0.4% m-o-m and 8.3% y-o-y), we believe that other business loans, such as the larger corporate enterprises climbed at a muted pace of 2.8% y-o-y (-0.7% m-o-m).By sub-segment, yearly demand for working capital improved by 5.2% y-o-y (-0.3% m-o-m). By sector, yearly demand for loans in the primary agriculture segment contracted for the 12th straight month. Total advances for the segment slipped 3.8% y-o-y (-0.3% m-o-m). Demand for loans for the mining and quarrying and education and health segments reversed gains in January to contract by 21.3% y-o-y (18.6% m-o-m) and 1.3% y-o-y (+0.2% m-o-m) respectively.Loans drawn down in the transport, storage and communications remained healthy, broadening by 5.8% y-o-y (+0.5% m-o-m).The drivers of business loans include wholesale and retail trade (+7.1% y-o-y), manufacturing (+9.7% y-o-y) and construction (+10.7% y-o-y). Also continuing their positive momentum — finance, insurance and business activities — registered positive y-o-y growth of 7% y-o-y.Meanwhile, year-to-date net funds raised by the private sector via the issue of new shares and new issue of debt securities (excluding redemptions) rose to RM9.1 billion versus RM6.9 billion a year ago.Loan applications fell by 14.0% y-o-y in February. M-o-m, they fell  by 29.8%. The applications for consumer and business loans contracted by 8.4% y-o-y and 20.7% y-o-y respectively.  By segment, the applications to buy residential mortgages and personal uses also fell during the month, down 0.7% y-o-y (-27.9% m-o-m) and -15.5% y-o-y (-30.6% m-o-m). The applications for credit cards declined by another 17.7% y-o-y (-28.2% m-o-m), which we believe was spurred by the new sales and services tax imposed on the cards, while yearly change in the application for hire purchase (HP) loans decreased for the sixth consecutive month by 12% y-o-y (+31.8% m-o-m).Total loans approved declined in February 2019. The 6.7% y-o-y reduction in loan approvals was again mostly driven by the consumer segment (-13.7% y-o-y). On the other hand, yearly approvals for the business segment improved (+4.4% y-o-y). The overall approval rate stood at 46.9% (February 2018: 43.3%), supported by business and consumer approval rates of 48.4% and 45.9% respectively.By major sub-segments, approval for the purchase of residential properties and non-residential properties stood at 42.1% and 37.8% versus 46% and 31.3% in February 2018 while the approval for HP loans stood at 63.6% versus 62% a year ago.Total deposits (excluding repurchase agreement) advanced by 6% y-o-y and 0.3% m-o-m. Current account savings account (Casa) balances in commercial banks also accelerated at a stronger pace of 1.9% y-o-y (+1.0% m-o-m).The Casa ratio stood at 26.4% versus 27.5% a year ago. Reporting one month in arrears, the liquidity coverage ratio rose y-o-y to 144% (January 2018: 132%) while the loan-to-fund ratio stood slipped to 82.8% (February 2018: 83.5%). The average lending rate was of little changed m-o-m at 5.43% February 2019 (January 2019: 5.44%), but increased by a slight two basis points as compared to 5.41% a year ago.Elsewhere, the banking system’s capital buffers remained ample with common equity tier and total capital ratio of 13.6% and 17.9% respectively.We maintain our 2019 loan growth projection at 5% — underpinned by business and consumer loan growth of 5.2% and 4.8% respectively. Despite some acceleration in business loans in the earlier part of the year, we gather that business activities remain in cautious mode. In the consumer segment, we  foresee sentiment to remain modest, going forward, underpinned by anticipation of cautious spending following bleak economic outlook and rising cost of living.

Corporate loan growth moderated 4.7% y-o-y in February, from 5.4% in January, due to fewer loans given to the mining, real estate, agriculture and utility sectors.However, this was mitigated by sustained demand for loans in some sectors — manufacturing, wholesale and retail, construction, financial and business services, transport and storage — said Loo.Household-sector loans also decreased further in February to 5.2% y-o-y, from 5.5% in January, constituting six consecutive months of declines after peaking in August 2018.This followed the banking sector’s winding down of residential property loans, as well as reductions seen in consumer loans such as car loans, leading to consumption credit dipping to 1.8% y-o-y from 2.1% last year.“The industry’s loan base grew a lacklustre 0.1% in the first two months of 2019. This reaffirms our expectation of a slowdown in loan growth from 5.6% in 2018 to a projection of about 5% in 2019,” CIMB Research said in a note yesterday.TA Securities has also forecast a loan growth of 5% for the year, while AmInvestment Bank’s projection is between 4% and 5%, according to their research reports yesterday.Comparatively, Loo expects loan growth to “remain healthy” at 5.2% this year compared with 5.6% in 2018.Notably, most publicly listed banks have set loan growth targets of above 5% for this year — for example, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s 6% and Malayan Banking Bhd’s system loan growth of 5.1%.CIMB Research analyst Winson Ng opined that weak loan applications and approvals in the first two months of 2019 bode ill for overall loan growth of Malaysia’s banking sector for the next one to two months.“We still rate Malaysian banks as ‘neutral’ given concerns over margin erosion and an uptick in credit costs,” Ng said, although he cited that the dividend yield is attractive at a projected 4.1% this year.Loo opined that BNM would keep its overnight policy rate unchanged at 3.25% in 2019, although the space for monetary easing has grown considerably given that other central banks are moving away from a monetary tightening stance.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lower-demand-loans-plagues-malaysian-banks,"2019-05-01 20:05:20"

249,"April 01, 2019 08:50 am +08",CIMB,"Mynews embraces changes","KUALA LUMPUR: Not keeping up with the ever-evolving times, and failing to understand what consumers need, was how Kodak went out of business.Mynews Holdings Bhd, the second largest convenience store chain operator after 7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Bhd, seems to be one that is responsive to consumers’ preferences and demands.In fact, its chief executive officer (CEO) Dang Tai Luk has been fine-tuning his business model, turning MyNews into a convenience store chain in Malaysia from being just a single news stand 22 years ago.“We managed to innovate and change our concept as we moved forward. And we were saved,” said Dang.He noted that Mynews had to always be on its toes to keep up with the fast-changing market, adding that the company had been exploring other convenience stores overseas.“This is a very interesting market segment. It’s very exciting as it is continuously changing.”“Convenience stores are where you can walk into a 1,000-sq ft place, and you can find 2,000 different items and also having it close to where you are staying,” said Dang.Unfazed by competition, Dang said: “We are not stopping. We are undertaking powerful projects and initiatives to put ourselves ahead of the pack.”And one of its plans is to embark on the ready-to-eat (RTE) food business, transferring the know-how and the way of doing it from the Japanese.“There will be a cultural change, whereby people will want to be able to buy their food and pick it up fast,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.“I believe that there will come a time when we will be one of the major game changers in terms of expectations from consumers for providing them the quality and hygiene they are expecting,” said Dang.Its food processing centre (FPC) is scheduled for completion by the middle of this year, which will distribute genuine Japanese-quality RTE and bakery products, said Dang, adding that the FPC is expected to supply to 150 stores this year and 300 stores next year.Three years ago, at the time of its listing, the RTE business only contributed 5% of the group’s total revenue, and it is 12% now, said Dang.With the FPC to be on board this year, he expects 17% of total revenue to be derived from the RTE business this year.Now, in some of its stores, Mynews is offering soft-serve ice cream and fresh brewed coffee at its Maru Kafe, which officially opened in October 2018. This is pretty similar to FamilyMart’s famous green tea ice cream and oden counter — which is no stranger to Malaysians.Mynews is seeing a 20% annual growth in customer count, while the average spending is above RM6 per customer and increasing with stores that have the Maru Kafe offering, said Dang.While the food and beverage segment makes up some 40% of its total offerings now, he sees an increase to 70%.Coupled with the improved product mix and offerings, Mynews has transitioned into a store with seating areas and free Wi-Fi, enabling better customer experience.“It (seating areas) also gels well for our forward plan of offering more food and beverages,” said Dang. Record momentum to continue into FY19With 85 new stores last year, Dang said Mynews is targeting to set up at least another 85 new stores this year. To date, Mynews has nearly 470 stores.“We are confident that we will still be able to open that same number of stores as we did last year and if we can do more, that will be a bonus for us,” said Dang.In line with this, Dang is optimistic about both Mynews’ top-line and bottom-line growth for the financial year ending Oct 31, 2019 (FY19).He expects last year’s bottom-line growth pace to continue into FY19 on the back of store expansion and its product mix as the company launches new products and services.In other words, Mynews is eyeing another good year in FY19.Its net profit jumped 30% to RM8.24 million for the first quarter ended Jan 31, 2019, from RM6.34 million last year, thanks to better sales and contributions from new outlets.Quarterly revenue grew 37% to RM123.5 million from RM90.12 million a year earlier.For the full FY18, net profit rose 10.34% to a record high of RM26.5 million, from RM24.02 million last year. Annual revenue expanded 19.5% to an all-time high of RM391.53 million from RM327.6 million previously.With the aggressive expansion of its outlet network, increases in revenue and profit are pretty much expected.On same-store sales, Mynews is hoping to see a single-digit growth this year.Dang believes there is still room for growth as convenience stores’ concentration and saturation are still low here partly because the modern outlets are replacing the traditional sundry shops.“I can tell you that Malaysians have not enjoyed ‘convenience’ because the convenience players here have yet to offer Malaysians as what is being offered by other regional peers [in Japan, Thailand and Taiwan],” said Dang.“We first began to focus on expanding into the malls. But now, the strategy is to go anywhere where there’s business. And now there are a lot of mixed developments and those are the captive market,” said Dang, noting that Mynews is very focused on the Klang Valley, of which 80% of its stores are set up.For 2019, the company has also set aside RM120 million for capital expenditure (capex), which will be funded via internal funds and bank borrowings. The bulk of it will be spent on plant construction and machinery, said Dang.Part of the capex will also be spent on new outlet expansion, equipment as well as information technology infrastructure, said Dang. Sound fundamentals but expensiveDespite the stellar performance, Mynews’ share price has not been in line. The counter closed at RM1.37 last Friday, valuing it at RM934.6 million.From the record high of RM1.74 on March 13, 2018, the stock has fallen some 21% over the past 12 months.While most analysts like the counter due to its strong fundamentals, Mynews is expensive valuation-wise — with a price-to-earnings ratio of 33 times.According to Bloomberg data, there are eight research houses covering the stock, with five “buy” calls, two “hold” ratings and one “sell”. Target prices for the counter range between RM1.25 and RM1.75.AmInvestment Bank analyst Nafisah Azmi forecast that Mynews will see net profit of RM34.9 million and RM42.2 million for FY19 and FY20 respectively, on revenue of RM431.6 million and RM482.3 million.“We like Mynews for its franchise opportunities arising from the myNews.com brand name, and growth potential of its FPC offering RTE and bakery products,” said Nafisah in a report dated March 25.“We are excited about the completion of the company’s FPC. However, we believe the initial gestation period would take about a year,” she said, adding that Mynews’ gross profit margin would improve, underpinned by a higher-margin contribution from the fresh food segment in the long run.Meanwhile, CIMB Research analyst Walter Aw projected that Mynews see net profit of RM32.24 million and RM41.79 million for FY19 and FY20 respectively, on revenue of RM509.4 million and RM629.2 million.According to a research note dated March 25, Aw had raised her FY19 to FY21 earnings per share estimates by 1.4% to 5.8%, taking into account the improved sales contributions, especially from “Heets” and RTE food products, higher economies of scale and adjustments to the adoption of Malaysian Financial Reporting Standard 16.Since mid-November 2018, Mynews has an exclusive nationwide contract for Heets — the tobacco product used in heat-not-burn smoking devices manufactured by Philip Morris International, said Aw.With the recent retracement in share price and improved earnings prospects, Aw had also upgraded Mynews to an “add” from “hold”.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mynews-embraces-changes,"2019-05-01 20:05:22"
250,"April 01, 2019 08:49 am +08",CIMB,"Marginal impact seen on banks if key rate cut materialises","KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian banks’ earnings are not expected to be severely impacted if Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) decides this year to cut the overnight policy rate (OPR) — which was last raised in January 2018 — to ease the pressure of downside risks to the economy.A reduction in OPR would cause an immediate impact on bank’s loan margin, which is based on a floating interest rate. But Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Chan Jit Hoong’s stress test shows that the impact would only be as much as 3% on the earnings of the banking industry as a whole.“We are not expecting any rate cut, but given that the Fed (US Federal Reserve) has turned dovish, the market thinks there is room for BNM to cut rate. So, assuming there is a symmetrical 25 basis points (bps) OPR cut for both variable loans and non-CASA (current account savings account) deposits, while all other factors remain constant, the average impact on banks’ earnings, on a sectoral basis, would be 2% to 3%.“From our sensitivity analysis, the two banks that might see the most impact would be Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd and BIMB Holdings Bhd, while the two banks that would see the least impact would be Affin Bank Bhd and AMMB Holdings Bhd,” Chan told The Edge Financial Daily when contacted.The estimated impact, albeit marginal, is based on the sector’s previous reaction when the OPR was last cut, which showed an usually larger reduction in lending rate compared to the reduction in deposit rate. “Historically, we noticed that quantum-wise, deposit rate did not come down as much as lending rate,” Chan said.In his note to investors last Wednesday, CIMB Research Winson Ng estimated that a 25bps cut in OPR would lower banks’ 2020 forecast net profit by about 3.2%.“This is based on the assumption of a 25bps reduction in base rate [and base lending rate] and an average of 22bp reduction in fixed deposit rate,” he said.Ng, similarly, is of the opinion that Alliance Bank and BIMB would be the two most affected banks in the event of a rate cut, as they have relatively higher floating-rate loans in their loan portfolio.“Based on our estimate, a 25bps rate cut would trim Alliance Bank and BIMB Holdings’ FY20 (financial year 2020) forecast net profit by 7% to 8%.“The impact would be smallest for AMMB, as its floating-rate loan ratio is one of the lowest among peers at 71.6% [for FY20]. We expect a 25bp cut in OPR will reduce AMMB’s FY20 forecast net profit by 2.3%,” he said.“The impact from the rate cut would also be relatively smaller for Maybank and Public Bank [compared to most other banks], partly because some portion of their loans (42% for Maybank and 7% for Public Bank as at end-December 2018) are from their overseas markets, which will not be impacted by the rate cut in Malaysia,” he added.Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd research head Pong Teng Siew, meanwhile, pointed out that when BNM raised the OPR last year — the rate was raised by 25bps to 3.25% in January — the impact on banks’ earnings was limited, with many still reporting decent profits in 2018. This was due mainly to banks’ cost-cutting measures, and lower loan loss provisions, Pong said.While a lower OPR could potentially entice more businesses to raise borrowings since financing costs would be lower, Pong said the higher volume of loans may not be sufficient to offset banks’ lower margins.“Higher volume may help offset banks’ loss in margin, but we expect the amount of loan to increase only marginally if BNM cuts the OPR. Also, do note that this marginal increase in loan may not be due to more business activities or economy expansion. It could just be because of a weaker ringgit.“Because of the weaker ringgit, some manufacturers have to borrow more working capital to buy the same amount of inventory they procured before,” he noted.Last Friday, the ringgit was seen trading at 4.082 against the US dollar, which is 5.5% weaker than when it was trading at 3.8692 a year ago.Market talks of the central bank’s potential decision to cut the OPR has been rife since the Monetary Policy Committee’s latest statement on March 5 this year, in which it mentioned “tighter global financial conditions and elevated political and policy uncertainty could lead to financial market adjustments, further weighing on the overall outlook”.“Materialisation of downside risks from unresolved trade tensions, heightened uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, and prolonged weakness in the commodity-related sectors could further weigh on growth,” the statement also noted.Since then, investors have been pricing in the risk of a cut in the key rate, which is reflected in the Bursa Malaysia Financial Services Index. The index has fallen 4.25% to 16,969.13 points last Friday, from its close of 17,722.22 points on March 4 this year.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/marginal-impact-seen-banks-if-key-rate-cut-materialises,"2019-05-01 20:05:23"

This was purportedly to obtain approval for an application by Nucleus Properties Sdn Bhd (now known as Paragon City Development Sdn Bhd) for a higher development plot ratio at Lot 228, Jalan Semarak, Kuala Lumpur.The offence was allegedly committed at the CIMB Bank branch at the Putra World Trade Centre on Jalan Tun Ismail on Dec 27, 2013.The charge, under Section 16(a) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, provides for imprisonment of up to 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the amount or value of the gratification, or RM10,000, whichever is higher, if an accused is found guilty.Tengku Adnan also faces an alternative charge where, in his capacity as the Federal Territories Minister, he is alleged to have received for himself RM1 million without consideration from Tan even though he knew Tan had done so because of his official position as the relevant minister.He was charged under Section 165 of the Penal Code for the offence and faces imprisonment of up to two years or a fine, or both, if found guilty.On Dec 12, Tengku Adnan was also charged as a public servant in his capacity as the Federal Territories Minister with receiving valuables, without consideration, amounting to RM2 million from one Chai Kin Kong, through a Hong Leong Islamic Bank cheque belonging to Aset Kayamas Sdn Bhd, that was deposited into a CIMB account belonging to Tadmansori Holding Sdn Bhd in which he (Tengku Adnan) had an interest and which he knew to be connected to his official functions.Tengku Adnan was charged with committing the offence at CIMB Bank Bhd, Pusat Bandar Damansara on June 14, 2016.He was then released on bail of RM500,000 and ordered to surrender his passport to the court.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ku-nans-application-retain-passport-fixed-mention-april-24,"2019-05-01 20:05:24"

The consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.4% in February from a year earlier, which was led by a drop in transport cost.In a strategy note dated March 27, CIMB Research's Ivy Ng said that overall, she was of the view that a 25-basis-point OPR cut may be a short-term positive for the market from a sentiment perspective.""However, it is likely to be negative for overall KLCI earnings, as the impact from the net interest margin squeeze on banks appear to be higher than potential interest savings for KLCI constituent companies.""This is because the net gearing of KLCI constituent companies (excluding banks) is only around 31%, and roughly 55% of their borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies,"" she said.Ng explained that OPR cuts are positive for cyclical sectors such as property, auto and consumer due to the increase in consumers' disposable income; however, the impact is not expected to be significant. Similarly, a rate cut is also positive for companies with high ringgit borrowings as it will result in lower interest expense, it said.On the other hand, Ng said an OPR cut is negative for banks, as the downward re-pricing of lending rates had historically been wider than the decrease in deposit rates, leading to potential narrowing in the banks' net interest margins. It is also negative for companies with high net cash balances as it will result in lower interest income.""Based on the above, we roughly estimate that a 25bp cut in base lending rate (BLR) could lower our market earnings estimates by 1% and our KLCI target of 1,638 points by 15 points.

He celebrated his last day last Friday, with a farewell breakfast with colleagues.“Thanks for the assistance and support!” Star Media editorial and corporate advisor Datuk Seri Wong Chun Wai posted on Instagram on the same day. On Jan 1, Chun Wai retired as group managing director and CEO of the media group.Chun Wai was with Star Media for more than 30 years. Yet, it was the arrival of Tan that gave the group its digital edge. With a background in media advertising and marketing, he joined the group’s digital division in 2013 and was later made chief digital officer.Eng Teng’s background is also not in the newsroom. He joined Prudential as chief information officer in January 2014 after a three-year stint as the head of regional applications management at CIMB Group Bhd, and was later promoted to chief transformation officer in charge of information technology at Prudential. Subsequently, he was appointed COO.Star Media has since seen several digital-focused transformations, such as replacing the position of editor-in-chief with chief content officer, and rebranding its editorial pieces as content.However, the transition has not always been smooth. One of the digital ventures Tan oversaw was dimsum, an over-the-top video streaming service launched in 2016 that has burnt as much as RM40 million to RM50 million to date, sources tell The Edge. It is learnt that some RM100 million had been budgeted for the venture.Tan told The Edge in an interview last year that dimsum “made exactly the amount of losses it should (have).” Even so, the new CEO is bound to review whether the venture is worth the cash bleed.“We are of view that dimsum is still in its gestation period. Coupled with competitive offerings in the market, we do not discount the possibility that it could take longer than expected for it to break even,” MIDF Research analyst Khoo Zhen Ye tells The Edge.Another analyst with a local research house opines that as Star Media invested in dimsum’s expansion to Singapore late last year, he thinks it is likely that the group will continue to push its case. “It may not be worth the impairments, and dimsum could also act as a new revenue stream in terms of non-intrusive advertisements and product placements,” the analyst shares. Have diversified revenue stream, say analystsThe new CEO will be joining at a turbulent time for the media industry as circulation and advertising revenue continue to slide.Star Media’s share price tumbled to a 19-year low of 63 sen after the group posted a maiden loss at the end of 2017. Ad revenue continues to decline.But the group’s cost rationalisation efforts have paid off to some extent. In its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, the group posted a net loss of RM9.6 million versus a loss of RM155.15 million in the corresponding quarter 2017 — 94% lower even though revenue declined 18.6% to RM93.04 million in the same quarter.Analysts say the group should stick to its current cost-cutting path, but caution that it does not address declining ad revenue.“Assuming advertising (revenue) intensity remains the same, Star Media should be able to uphold its earnings momentum. However, we view that there is a limit to its cost rationalisation strategy. The well-being of the group would still largely depend on its ability to generate higher revenue,” MIDF’s Khoo says.Another analyst who declined to be named concurred. “They can be profitable if they cut print-related costs, which is something they have been doing by shutting down the Penang printing plant,” the analyst opines.However, he adds the group is unlikely to see much growth if it relies solely on its media business.Although Star Media’s 4QFY2018 results exceeded expectations, analysts are still unconvinced. Of the 10 analysts that cover the stock, four have a “sell” call while five recommend a “hold”, according to Bloomberg data.Only CIMB Research recommends a “buy”, largely for its undemanding valuations, net cash position and property assets.That said, investors seem to have responded positively to its latest results. The stock has gained 12 sen or 17.91% since the start of the year. It closed last Friday at 78 sen, valuing the media group at RM576.08 million.It is worth noting that while changes to the group’s management may be afoot, Star Media’s largest shareholder has not changed. The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) still held a controlling 42.46% stake in the media group as at March 15.In fact, its independent non-executive chairman Datuk Fu Ah Kiow is one of three members of a temporary special committee formed to oversee operations at Star Media following Chun Wai’s retirement earlier this year.The question remains as to how much the arrival of a new CEO — especially one who is less of a news hound but more IT savvy — will change things for one of the oldest media companies on Bursa Malaysia. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/newsbreak-star-medias-incoming-ceo-signals-tech-pivot,"2019-05-01 20:05:33"

266,"March 26, 2019 11:30 am +08",CIMB,"My Say: Policy certainty and investor confidence","There was a stir in the news flow when Khazanah Nasional Bhd’s financial results were released earlier this month. The fund posted its first loss in 15 years — a RM6.27 billion loss before tax in 2018 compared to a RM2.9 billion profit before tax in 2017. The losses were from impairments of some of its investments — a whopping RM7.3 billion. The more appropriate measure of its performance, however, and the more telling one, is the 21.6% drop in the net worth adjusted (NWA) of the portfolio from RM116 billion in 2017 to RM91 billion in 2018.A more detailed look shows that the value of Khazanah’s holdings in its two telcos alone, Axiata Group Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), lost RM8.5 billion in market capitalisation, while the drop in the share prices of Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (CIMB) and IHH Healthcare Bhd (IHH) contributed to the contraction of the NWA. Clearly, market sentiment towards these major Khazanah investee companies turned negative, resulting in the drop of their share prices. The share price of TM opened 2018 at above RM6 and closed the year at RM2.65, hitting a low of RM2.15 along the way. The FBM KLCI, by contrast, contracted only 3% in 2018.The explanation for the contraction of the NWA is a rather straightforward one. While overall market sentiments softened in 2018, the FBM KLCI still outperformed both the MSCI Global and Emerging Market indices. The 21.6% drop in Khazanah’s NWA is, therefore, peculiar to its holdings in selected companies — TM, Axiata, TNB, CIMB, IHH and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB). There were policy and regulatory changes in 2018 that affected these particular companies and, therefore, market sentiments towards them. Herein lies a larger issue.These same companies, all of them public companies, have other investors, institutional and retail, domestic and foreign. These investors too suffered the same losses as Khazanah. Major domestic institutional investors such as the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP) must have invested in these historically well-performing companies and they, too, will have suffered similar losses in value, which will affect both their portfolio values as well as the dividends they pay out to their respective subscribers.Beyond these domestic institutional investors, there are also foreign funds that invest in good performing Malaysian companies. They, too, will have invested in these same companies and they would have suffered the same losses. While some domestic institutional investors are constrained from investing in domestic markets, foreign investors are free to move to where the risk-weighted returns are the best. Some of them have exited our market, with net foreign fund outflow for 2018 totalling RM11.6 billion.What has happened is that policy and regulatory changes adversely affected market sentiments — not just for the specific companies but, more alarmingly, for the Malaysian market more generally. These sporadic bouts of policy changes would have been tolerated by investors if they were part of a broader policy shift that is well communicated and understood, but that is not the case.In the case of the telcos, policy and regulatory changes — on what should have been commercial decisions such as product design and pricing — seriously affected earnings forecasts and, therefore, investors’ valuations of the companies. The drop in share prices simply reflect that outlook. This is the kind of regulatory risks that investors are fearful of. They are capable of assessing companies’ operational efficiency as well as locating them properly within the industry landscape but it is regulatory risks that present a challenge and thus constitutes the larger bulk of risk.Changes in regulatory regimes that are seen as reacting to specific impetus without a broader coherence will just increase the risk profile of Malaysia as a whole. The Malaysian economy can ill-afford the increased risk profile. Our current account surplus has dwindled over the years, closing 2018 at barely 3% of gross domestic product, and it is not expected to improve given sluggish trade sentiments, while the need to borrow and refinance debts will continue. Portfolio outflows make things worse. Therefore, maintaining investors’ confidence and managing the country’s risk profile is of utmost importance.What is still missing at the policy level today is a big picture economic story — phrased positively in terms of what it is rather than what it is not. That will set a direction, a focal point for all other subsidiary stories. It will also identify the lynchpins of the story — the key economic imperatives that drive the whole story, among which, I reckon, is to protect investors’ confidence.Matters of policy relate to the boundary between the state and markets. What is the role of the government in the economy? From the perspective of the capital market, terms like government-linked companies (GLCs) should be properly used or its usage abandoned altogether. Policy and regulations cannot discriminate between GLCs and non-GLCs if a company, a public company, is deemed a GLC merely because statutory funds whose monies do not belong to the government, such as the EPF, PNB and Social Security Organisation (Socso) have shares in it. Are Sime Darby, Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB, Axiata and IJM Corp Bhd government-related companies?In the case of sectors where there used to be natural monopolies, such as utilities and airports, privatised public enterprises such as TNB, TM and Malaysia Airports may still have government holdings in the form of Khazanah shares in them, but these are publicly listed companies with sizeable private and even international investors, and they should neither be favoured nor made victims of policy or regulations.These are commercial entities and should be treated as such — treated by how they behave in the marketplace rather than according to their lineage or even the composition of their shareholders. Commercial disputes between companies, for example, should be matters resolved by the rule of law without the parentage of companies being taken into consideration, what more direct government intervention.The whole point of the Putrajaya Committee for GLC High Performance programme launched in 2004 was to improve the performance of the 20 publicly listed companies that had either significant holdings by statutory funds or a governmental legacy so that they are subjected to market discipline and their governance be made equally transparent.When the 10-year programme ended in 2015, the total shareholder return of these 20 companies grew at 11.1% annually and their aggregate market capitalisation increased from RM133.8 billion to RM386 billion — almost a three times multiple.Beyond that, the regulatory environment was improved mainly by clearly demarcating policy, which can get enmeshed with the political imperative of the government and regulation, which should be driven by promoting healthy competition to attract investors into industries. Empowering shareholders and the presence of regulators, independent of policymakers, create a rules-based environment, the kind of environment investors prefer.The problematic part of government’s presence in the economy are the numerous companies established by the various statutory bodies. There has been a proliferation of these companies. These are not government-linked companies, but outright government-owned, effectively state-owned enterprises (SOEs). They should be properly labelled and need some sort of rationalisation, and a major part of public sector reform should be a serious re-examination of the government’s use of non-governmental organisations — companies established under the Companies Act — as policy tools.The government has been using companies as policy tools in the form of SOEs to achieve bumiputera participation objectives but this approach has not worked. Compare this to the much better performance of funds such as PNB using the capital markets to invest and therefore support performing firms, but the firms they invest in should be treated neutrally by the regulations.These are not GLCs, certainly not SOEs, but public companies with a wide spectrum of investors whose collective performance defines the health of the country’s economy. Truth be told, PNB operating in the capital market has been more successful in achieving the bumiputera agenda objectives than most other policy tools.Clarity in these fundamental issues will create the right environment and the right incentives for investors to decide which enterprises to support and what, in their view, are potentially profitable ones. The government should have a facilitative and not a participative role. It should focus on providing policy clarity and regulatory certainty to attract investments. In order to obtain such an outcome, the government must first articulate a big picture story that sets a strategic direction understood by all interested parties.Nungsari A Radhi is an economist.

In early December last year, Barakah changed its financial year end to June 30 from Dec 30.For the first four quarters ended Dec 31, 2018, Barakah suffered a net loss of RM61.58 million from RM243.25 million in revenue. As at end-December, the company had cash and bank balances of RM44. 97 million and fixed deposits with licensed banks amounting to RM85.71 million while on the other side of the balance sheet, it had long-term borrowings of RM172.02 million and short-term debt obligations of RM2.21 million.It is worth noting that the debt obligations of Barakah stated in its restructuring plan are almost four times that stated in its latest balance sheet. The restructuring planThe restructuring plan has two parts. The first addresses PBJV while the second involves Barakah and entails a share premium consolidation, capital reduction, private placement of irredeemable convertible loan stocks (ICULS) and issuance of redeemable convertible unsecured loan stocks (RCULS), among others.PBJV’s secured FI creditors are owed RM45.79 million and its unsecured FI creditors, RM85.58 million, bringing its total debt commitment to RM131.37 million. A chunk of its unsecured debt — RM85.12 million — is owed to EXIM Bank while the balance is with SME Bank.Secured lenders of PBJV include Affin Bank Bhd, Maybank, Public Bank Bhd and CIMB Bank Bhd.It seems that PBJV’s unsecured creditors, which are the FIs, are likely to be compensated by Barakah’s placement of ICULS and issue of RCULS.Unsecured creditors, meanwhile, fall into several categories, with some being settled in the ordinary course of business while others will have to take a 45% haircut.As for Barakah, according to the sources, the main tenets of the restructuring will see the secured FI creditors paid in the ordinary course of business as they are fully secured against fixed deposits pledged under lien.Meanwhile, all secured creditors of PBJV shall be secured up to the amount of their security value as at the cut-off date — June 30, 2018 — and any outstanding amount net of the security will be classified as an unsecured FI creditor and settled pursuant to the proposed debt restructuring scheme of PBJV.The secured creditor of Kota Laksamana 101 — EXIM Bank, which is owed RM172.3 million — will be secured up to RM87.15 million, which is equivalent to the forced sale value of its pipe-laying barge. Other details include the RM87.15 million being paid over a seven-year period, pegged with an interest rate of 5% per annum.The balance RM85.12 million owed is to be ranked as an unsecured FI creditor and settled as per a proposed debt restructuring scheme of PBJV and restructuring of Barakah.Meanwhile, RM17.24 million owed by Kota Laksamana 101 is slated to be waived.Barakah is seeking to place its unsecured creditors (RM384.59 million) in several categories, with some, such as essential creditors, to be settled in full while others could see a waiver of as much as 45% of the debt.Barakah’s restructuring plan requires approval from Bursa Malaysia, the Securities Commission Malaysia, the High Court and all its creditors — secured and unsecured — as well as at the Barakah, PBJV and Kota Laksamana 101 levels and shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting. Barakah’s woesLike other oil and gas players, Barakah had been severely hit by the downturn as crude oil prices fell sharply in 2014 and remained volatile since.Its largest shareholders are CEO Nik Hamdan Daud, with 35.65% equity interest, and Tan Sri Yaw Teck Seng of the Samling group fame, with an 8.97% stake. The Federal Land Development Authority ceased to be a substantial shareholder last June.According to exchange filings, MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd is assisting Barakah in its restructuring.Earlier this month, Barakah announced that a restraining order (RO) against its creditors had been extended for another 90 days, commencing on Jan 14. It was granted the RO on Oct 12 last year.The RO is for Barakah to manage the debt levels of the company and PBJV. It also allows Barakah and its units to negotiate terms with its lenders and creditors without having the threat of any proceedings and actions being brought against the company.In January, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), in a letter — sighted by The Edge — cautioned that PBJV had been suspended by the national oil company since last June due to non-performance. The letter was addressed to several oil and gas players.Petronas also highlighted that there had been complaints about PBJV being financially distressed and not paying its subcontractors. It suggested that a risk assessment and due diligence be undertaken before any jobs are awarded to PBJV.Last August, Barakah bagged a pan-Malaysian maintenance, construction and modification (MCM) contract for a five-year tenure from Sapura Energy Bhd. While the value of the contract was not disclosed, it is understood to exceed RM1 billion.Back then, when Barakah was awarded the contract, Nik Hamdan was reported to have said, “We are pleased to have secured the MCM contract. It is expected to contribute positively to the group’s bottom line and replenish our order book while keeping us occupied for the next five years. Moving forward, we believe 2019 will be an exciting year for us as more oil and gas projects are expected to come onstream following a recovery in the sector.”Barakah closed last Friday at 12.5 sen, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM104.47 million.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/barakah-seeks-restructure-rm726-mil-debt-0,"2019-05-01 20:05:35"

The funds will be used to refinance existing debt that matures in May and for working capital, one of the people said.Bumi Armada swung to a loss last year as lower crude prices hurt demand for its offshore oilfield services, making it more difficult for the company to pay back its debt. The company had RM10.4 billion (US$2.5 billion) of total borrowings at the end of December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.The loan would give Bumi Armada breathing room to sell assets and restructure its business in a bid to return to profitability, one of the people said. The company is expected to sign the loan agreement with lenders as soon as the next few weeks, the people said.Shares of Bumi Armada rose as much as 5.4% in Monday morning trading. They were up 2.7% to 19 sen at the mid-day break in Kuala Lumpur, on track for the biggest gain in a week.“The company has stated that it is working with the lenders and aims to have a refinancing of the corporate debt in place by the end of April,” a representative for Bumi Armada said, declining to comment further. “That remains the current position.”Debt ConcernsLocal brokerage JF Apex Securities Bhd. cut its recommendation on the stock this month to “hold,” from “buy,” over concerns about its debt refinancing as well as execution risks and lower crude oil prices.

270,"March 25, 2019 16:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Newsbreak: ‘Al Rajhi’s Saudi owner to stay, post-merger’ ","A merger between Malaysian Industrial Development Finance Bhd (MIDF) and Al Rajhi Banking & Investment Corp (M) Bhd (Al Rajhi Malaysia) is likely to be an all-share deal as the latter’s Saudi Arabian owner wants to stay on as a shareholder, sources familiar with the matter say.Al Rajhi Malaysia is wholly owned by Al Rajhi Bank, the world’s largest Islamic lender by assets. Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) wholly owns MIDF.“It will probably be an all-share deal as the Saudi [owner] isn’t looking to exit. It is understood to want to remain as a shareholder [in the enlarged entity],” one of the sources tells The Edge.Sources say the parties are still at an early stage of talks and have yet to discuss pricing and valuation. “They’re still doing due diligence and looking at each other’s books,” one says.It may be possible for a merger agreement to be entered into by the end of 2Q2019 or early 3Q2019, the source adds.On Jan 10, MIDF announced that it had obtained Bank Negara Malaysia’s approval to embark on merger talks with Al Rajhi Malaysia. The central bank gave the parties three months to complete negotiations.But with Bank Negara’s early April deadline looming and merger talks still at an early stage, some wonder if the parties may have to ask the central bank for an extension.According to sources, MIDF and PNB are being advised by JPMorgan, while Al Rajhi Malaysia is being advised by Hong Leong Investment Bank in Singapore.It is no secret that MIDF, a development financial institution (DFI), aspires to become an Islamic bank. Merging with an Islamic lender like Al Rajhi Malaysia is one way of getting there.MIDF already does some Islamic financing but there are limits to what it can do without a licence. For example, it cannot collect retail deposits — one of the cheaper sources of funding for re­gular banks.“[Having an Islamic banking licence] would give MIDF the flexibility of conduc­ting a wider range of businesses, including payments and internet banking,” a source told The Edge late last year.Should a merger with Al Rajhi Malaysia pan out, PNB will likely remain the largest shareholder in the enlarged entity, observers say.Al Rajhi Malaysia, which set up operations in October 2006, and Kuwait Finance House (M) Bhd are currently the only two remaining banks with Middle Eastern roots in Malaysia.The two were among the first banks to make their foray into Malaysia after the country opened up its Islamic banking sector to foreign players.Al Rajhi Malaysia’s shareholder may be keen on the merger with MIDF to streng­then the bank’s position in Malaysia. The lender started out with a retail banking focus but has struggled to make strides in that space a decade on. Following the appointment of Steve Chen as CEO in April 2016, the bank decided to put a stronger focus on corporate banking.In September 2017, the bank revealed that its three-year strategy to 2020 would also see it return to prioritising retail banking, but this time, with a focus on the affluent segment. Digital banking is a key part of its agenda.Neither MIDF nor Al Rajhi Malaysia are public listed entities. If merged, they would have combined assets of about RM14.09 billion — relatively small compared with the assets of Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd of over RM59 billion. Bank Islam is the country’s largest standalone Islamic bank.Of the two, Al Rajhi Malaysia seems to be the bigger entity in terms of assets and profitability. Based on the unaudited interim financial statements posted on its website, the bank made a net profit of RM18.49 million for the nine months to Sept 30, 2018, almost three times more than RM6.43 million a year ago.Revenue, at RM321.09 million, was slightly lower than RM338.02 million a year ago.The bank had an asset size of RM7.79 billion and a gross financing book of RM5.14 billion. A large portion of its financing book comprises corporate and home financing. Significantly, it has shown an annual profit every year since 2009.MIDF, however, slipped to a net loss of RM21.49 million in 9MFY2018 compared with a net profit of RM40.52 million a year ago. Its losses were because of higher expected credit loss allowance on loans, financing and advances, as well as financial instruments, of RM57.2 million. This came about after the new MFRS 9 accounting standard kicked in last year.MIDF made an operating profit of RM48.2 million for the nine months, which was lower than the RM55.95 million seen in the same period a year ago. Operating revenue increased slightly to RM256.99 million from RM252.33 million previously. It had an asset size of RM6.3 billion.MIDF was set up 58 years ago as the country’s maiden DFI. Its role was to ensure local manufacturing-based companies had access to financing. But it has since transformed into a more diversified group, with its key businesses being investment banking, development finance and asset management.The bulk of its revenue and profit come from investment banking — via MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd — and development finance.In July, veteran investment banker Datuk Charon Wardini Mokhzani was appointed as its group managing director. Charon was previously head of investment banking operations at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.The last Islamic banking merger in Malaysia was that of Malaysia Building Society Bhd and Asian Finance Bank Bhd. AFB, owned by four Middle Eastern shareholders, was acquired by MBSB early last year. MBSB, then a non-bank lender, had acquired AFB for its Islamic banking licence. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/newsbreak-al-rajhis-saudi-owner-stay-postmerger,"2019-05-01 20:05:35"
271,"March 25, 2019 14:00 pm +08",CIMB," Lead Story: Opportunities in oil & gas, construction","THE FBM KLCI may be the only major Asian stock market index to have slipped into the red, year to date, but investors who pivoted to small caps at the end of last year could be in a buoyant mood.This is because the FBM Small Cap Index’s total return of nearly 15% outperformed that of most major stock market indices. With a yield of 20%, only China’s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index provided better returns.Although the FBM KLCI recorded a slight 0.7% decline, Bursa Malaysia as a whole saw an 11.8% gain year to date, adding RM50.4 billion to its market capitalisation.This marks a strong recovery from the selldown in the second half of last year, which was led by foreign selling in the aftermath of a historic and unprecedented change in government after the 14th general election.A total of RM119.3 billion was wiped out of Bursa after GE14 in May until the end of last year.UOB Asset Management (M) Bhd chief investment officer Francis Eng sees the robust start in the small-cap space this year as a recovery from the selldown last year.He says there is value in selected small-cap companies following the decline last year and lists the preferred sectors as technology and manufacturing, particularly semiconductor equipment makers and consumer-related companies. “We also see pockets of opportunity in the beaten-down and unloved sectors, such as oil and gas and construction,” Eng tells The Edge.He attributes the performance of the small caps to the low base effect. “Amid the headwinds faced by emerging markets, including Asia, last year, the FBM KLCI was one of the better performing indices with a decline of 5.9%.“In comparison, the decline in the FBM Small Cap Index was much sharper at 33.7%. Even with the gain year to date, the FBM Small Cap Index is still down 23.9% compared with the start of last year. We attribute the improved performance of the FBM Small Cap Index this year to its relative underperformance last year and improved risk appetite as the headwinds faced by Asia have reduced.”Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong also believes last year’s selldown has created openings for investors looking beyond the benchmark index. Among his pick of sectors to invest in is oil and gas, which has seen a turnaround this year, in line with the recovery in Brent crude prices. “We actually returned to the oil and gas space towards the end of last year as we felt most of the downside had been priced in. Of course, the price of oil plays a role in lifting the mood of investors but what’s important is that we’re also seeing more activities this year,” Wong observes.Coming off last year’s “yo-yo trend” — thanks to the uncertainties raised by production cuts led by Opec+ as well as the tweets of US President Donald Trump on oil prices — Brent crude hit a multi-year high of US$84.93 per barrel in October before slipping to a one-year low of US$50.47 at the end of last year. Prices had inched up to US$67.80 per barrel at the time of writing.Given its average return of 45.5% year to date, oil and gas is the top performing sector so far this year, its upward trend lifting stocks in the category.Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd returned to the black in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, with a net profit of RM97.72 million, and has since been rewarded with a 213% surge in its share price.Also impressive is Petra Energy Bhd’s 189% gain after bouncing back into positive territory in its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, with a net profit of RM20.88 million.Other players trending upwards include Uzma Bhd, Velesto Energy Bhd, T7 Global Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd and Sapura Energy Bhd.Notable improvements have also been seen in construction, whose average return is 24.8% year to date. David Loh, senior portfolio manager at Affin Hwang Asset Management, says a possible revival of the East Coast Rail Link has lifted sentiments on the sector, which was hit by a slew of project cancellations last year.“Judging from public statements made by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the project’s cost should drop substantially to below RM30 billion. This can be achieved by tweaking ECRL’s design and lowering its specifications. If you assume 30% local content, the jobs available to Malaysian contractors is only RM9 billion,” he says, adding that as competition for the tender packages is expected to be intense, margins are unlikely to be great.His firm has taken positions in selective construction stocks that are trading far below their asset value. “We believe there is potential in these companies to monetise assets and unlock value for shareholders. Should that happen, management can use the sale proceeds to pay special dividends and pare down borrowings.”There are also signs of interest in companies that were previously shunned by investors for their perceived links with the previous Barisan Nasional (BN) government.KUB Malaysia Bhd, MyEG Services Bhd, Media Prima Bhd and George Kent (M) Bhd are some of the counters that have seen a surge in buying volume.Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau believes small caps will continue to enjoy an uptick but he also points to external risks, including the ongoing US-China trade talks as well as Brexit negotiations. FBM KLCI not reflective of marketTo Areca Capital’s Wong, the FBM KLCI is not reflecting Bursa and has been dragged down by a few notable decliners this year, namely Petronas Dagangan Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Top Glove Corp Bhd.“The benchmark index only consists of 30 companies and it was dragged down by a few heavyweights while the banking sector, which dominates the index, has been relatively flat so far,” he says.For instance, TNB, which has about 9.95% weightage on the FBM KLCI, is down 6.6% year to date while CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (7.38% weightage) has shed 4.6%.An analyst with a local investment bank agrees, saying newcomers to the benchmark index, such as the glove manufacturers as well as Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd, which have done well in the past few years, have been affected by profit-taking activities as their valuations are near historical highs.The top decliners so far among the indice’s component stocks are Hartalega (25%), Top Glove (22%) and Sime Darby Bhd (10%).Genting Bhd and Genting Malaysia Bhd, on the other hand, are the top gainers with a total return of 16.1% and 14.6% respectively, followed by IHH Healthcare Bhd at 9.6%.Despite their strong gains, the total weightage of the three counters only makes up 8% of the benchmark index — less than TNB on its own.With the year just a fortnight shy of its quarter mark, investors are likely to have more to cheer about than to moan, given that 356 counters have posted double-digit gains, 265 counters are on a positive trend and only 224 counters are in the red.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-opportunities-oil-gas-construction,"2019-05-01 20:05:36"

273,"March 25, 2019 10:28 am +08",CIMB,"Still lack of growth catalysts despite share price at multi-year low","KUALA LUMPUR: Last year, plantation companies were the big losers by share price performance on Bursa Malaysia.The reason was that planters had a bad year in 2018. Their earnings dropped sharper than expected, no thanks to lower sales and lower average selling prices of fresh fruit bunches (FFB), crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel.For Genting Plantations Bhd, its annual net profit halved to RM164.90 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18), against RM335.09 million the year before, dragged by weaker selling prices. Its improved revenue on higher offtake of biodiesel and refinery products from its downstream manufacturing segment together with progressive completion of works at its property segment, however, was not strong enough to stem the fall on profit.Likewise, Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd’s net profit plunged 74% from RM232.92 million to RM61.30 million in 2018, its lowest net profit  in 12 years for quite similar reasons as Genting Plantations. Just few plantation stocks, such as United Plantations Bhd and Genting Plantations, eked out marginal gains on share price. Most of the rest had fallen more than 25% in the course of a year, Bloomberg data showed.Fundsupermart Research analyst Jerry Lee Chee Yeong foresees limited growth moving forward, although most of the industry’s negative factors have been priced in. “At this moment, we do not see any strong catalysts that could drive earnings for the plantation sector, especially for the CPO players. The sector is uninteresting in our view and would be rather flattish this year,” Lee told The Edge Financial Daily.Nonetheless, CIMB regional head of agribusiness Ivy Ng sees CPO production, which improved 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the first two months of 2019, bodes well for plantation earnings. But this is likely to be more than offset by the 17% y-o-y decline in CPO prices and rising costs due to higher minimum wages, she added.Ng sees average CPO prices at RM2,400 a tonne this year.AllianceDBS Research, however, is more positive. It expects CPO prices to be at RM2,560 in FY19, RM2,560 in FY20 and RM2,590 in FY21, helped by an incremental two million tonnes in palm oil demand as a result of Indonesia’s B20 mandate.This will be supported by a pickup in demand due to the dissipating effects of bumper crops from Indonesia last year. The restocking activities from India and China, as well as slower output growth as FFB yields are also not expected to fully normalise to its 2015 level will lend support to edible oil prices.“Malaysian plantation players mostly have upstream exposure, which is why we believe the profitability of most plantation players are expected to improve significantly year-on-year on the back of an increase in CPO prices due to high operating leverage.“Having said this, crude palm kernel oil and coconut oil prices have been depressed thus far and if CPO prices remain depressed, the lower feedstock cost for oleochemicals is expected to cushion some of the fall in upstream earnings,” the research firm said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/still-lack-growth-catalysts-despite-share-price-multiyear-low,"2019-05-01 20:05:37"

Worse still, plantation companies already suffered a blow to their earnings last year.The worst-case scenario is that the Malaysian palm oil industry loses its grip on its second-largest export market, the European Union (EU), entirely. Industry experts, however, believe there is no need to be overly worried as it is only a matter of a balancing act, but there are certain risks to watch out for. Looming palm oil trade warThe EU market was both Malaysia and Indonesia’s second-largest palm oil export destination last year. In 2018, Malaysia exported a total of 1.91 million tonnes of palm oil to the EU — down 4% from 1.99 million tonnes recorded in 2017 — and accounting for 12% of Malaysia’s total 2018 palm oil exports, data from the industry regulator Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) showed.Our biggest EU buyers were the Netherlands at 912,592 tonnes last year, mostly for food consumption, followed by Italy at 351,221 tonnes and Spain at 361,640 tonnes. For Indonesia, a large portion of its exports to the bloc were reportedly used for biofuel.About 3.7 million tonnes of palm oil biodiesel are exported to the EU from Malaysia currently, according to CIMB regional head of agribusiness Ivy Ng.The EU’s executive arm’s (the European Commission) draft regulation concluded that palm oil cultivation causes excessive deforestation and that its use in biofuels should be reduced to zero by 2030. The EU Parliament and member countries have two months to decide whether to accept or veto the regulation.The banning of palm oil as an additive for biofuel and the eventual phasing out of palm oil is expected to reduce palm oil exports of Malaysia and Indonesia by about 6.5 million tonnes, equivalent to about 9% of the total palm oil production, Alliance DBS Research guided. So will the biodiesel mandate help?Analysts are of the view that Malaysia’s B10 biodiesel mandate for the transportation sector, and B7 for the industrial sector, are insufficient to offset fully the impact should Malaysia lose the EU as its key market.AllianceDBS Research in an email reply to The Edge Financial Daily’s questions commented that the Malaysian government needs to come up with a proper contingency plan before it loses its grip on the EU market as impacts on Malaysian palm oil demand would be “very detrimental”.“The Malaysian government has to do all it could to counter this act. The [current] B10 biodiesel mandate would be enough to cushion the impact of the decrease in palm oil imports from the EU in the short run, but not in the long run.“Indonesia has already put together policies to absorb the forgone demand from the EU. Its biodiesel mandate has factored in the possibility of the complete phase-out of palm oil,” the research firm said.While the world’s biggest producer of palm oil expanded the mandatory use of a 20% biodiesel blend last September, it is already mulling further domestic biodiesel consumption to 30%, or even 100%, to help absorb more crude palm oil (CPO). Its energy and mineral resources ministry is reportedly testing the B100 fuel as we speak.But the Malaysian mandate at best could absorb an insignificant 3% of the country’s production, compared with the much more meaningful Indonesian B20 mandate, which is expected to consume about 13% of stockpile, the AllianceDBS Research analyst added.RHB Research regional head of plantation Hoe Lee Leng commented that the loss of an EU market may not necessarily warrant serious concerns to Malaysia in the long run.“Looking at the bigger picture, and on a longer-term basis, if we were to lose the EU market, we need not worry too much,” she told The Edge Financial Daily when contacted.“The successful implementation of Indonesia’s B30 biodiesel mandate, which will increase uptake from five million tonnes to eight million tonnes, would be able to offset most of the over three million tonnes of palm oil consumed in the EU for biodiesel that are to be taken out of the equation,” she added.She also observes that there is increasing emerging market demand from countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Vietnam, which have shown higher compound annual growth rates compared with Malaysia’s traditional markets such as India and China. Toppling dominosBut one thing to look out for — besides the downtrend in prices — is the cascading effects of a palm oil phase out, analysts cautioned.Last Friday, the benchmark third-month palm oil contract on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange fell RM7 to close at RM2,167 a tonne, its first drop in six sessions. The futures had risen to its highest since March 4 in the previous session — its largest weekly climb since November 2016.But when compared with its 2016 peak, prices have fallen nearly RM1,000 a tonne — from RM3,127. On a year-on-year basis, CPO prices have declined more than RM250 per tonne.“The only worry is if this (the phasing out of palm oil) spreads to food production. But at the end of the day, the EU would then have to find replacement vegetable oils, which could drive up the prices of substitute oil and they would then be kicking themselves in their foot,” said Hoe of RHB Research.“Malaysia — and Indonesia — will need to get out there and fight the fight. The phase out is to take effect in 2030 and will be negative for sentiments, but we do have some time before this happens,” she said.“Malaysia cannot afford to lose the EU market, not because of the loss of earnings but damage to reputation can be irreparable,” Sathia Varqa, owner of Singapore-based Palm Oil Analytics, concurred.Varqa said Malaysia and Indonesia may easily find replacements from the displacement to the EU, but when it comes to the reputation of palm oil, it will be a lot more difficult for Malaysia to rebut.This will be especially true if the ban leads to policies in other countries or in other areas of palm oil use, transpiring from a domino effect of the bloc’s decision. He pointed out that plantation companies that are overly dependent on exports to Rotterdam will be badly affected by dwindling market share and therefore, deterioration in earnings.So far, top palm oil producing countries Indonesia and Malaysia — which supply some 85% of the crop — have threatened to ban imports of some goods from the EU as a retaliatory measure.In Malaysia, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the government may decide to ban certain imports from the EU countries over the bloc’s discrimination against palm oil exports.“We think we will stop buying some European products, that is one thing we can do,” he told reporters at the Parliament lobby last week, after saying that Malaysia should be more aggressive in addressing the EU’s proposed restrictions towards palm oil use.Ministry of International Trade and Industry deputy secretary-general of trade Datuk Seri Norazman Ayob too had warned that free trade agreements with the EU and European Free Trade Association will face challenges, should there be continued discrimination against Malaysian palm oil.Against this backdrop, will the dispute over edible oil dispute start another trade war in this part of the world?",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/can-msia-afford-lose-eu-cpo-market,"2019-05-01 20:05:37"

(March 21, RM14.48)
Maintain buy with a target price of RM16.30: Allianz Malaysia Bhd remains a country top pick. With gross domestic product (GDP) growth projected at 4.6% for 2019, the insurance industry is likely to see extended softness in business growth. Still, we believe the company will continue to deliver above-average gross written premium (GWP) growth and respectable FY19F-20F (forecast) earnings growth of 5-6% per annum (pa). 
The general insurance industry saw muted 1.5% GWP growth in 2018 and is expected to register another year of slow growth in 2019. Allianz General Insurance Company (Agic), which recorded 6% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in bancassurance GWP in 2018, should continue to do better than peers, helped by its diversified portfolio and focus on delivering value to customers. Agic sees opportunities in the commercial SME segment, residential property sector, and the digital space. Recall that Agic’s Banca partnership with CIMB Bank ended in August 2017, after which a new 15-year partnership with Standard Chartered Bank commenced.Besides resiliency in the company’s GWP growth, we believe Agic’s profits would also be supported by gradual improvement in its combined ratio of 92.8% in FY18 (industry: 91.7%). Agic plans to increase its mix of non-motor business, from 40% of GWP to about 50% over time. The lower claims experience of its non-motor portfolio would eventually result in improved claims ratio for Agic, which in turn, would lead to an improved combined ratio.Allianz Life Insurance Malaysia’s (Alim) annualised new premium (ANP) growth has picked up strongly from 5-6% pa during FY14-16 to 15.3% in FY17, and 13.3% in FY18. This has led to an expanding market share of annualised new business — from 6.6% in 2016 to 8.4% in 2018. The healthy increase in ANP underpins Alim’s ability to deliver sustained growth in GWP and pretax profits. We expect Alim’s GWP to grow by 10% and 9% in FY19F-20F.We raised the group’s projected net profit by 4%-5% for FY19F-20F after factoring in improved expense ratio for Agic and stronger GWP for Alim. Our SOP-derived TP is upgraded to MYR16.30, which implies 1.6 times FY19F forward P/BV (historical average: 1.5 times). — RHB Research, March 21",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/better-showing-agic-alim-help-allianz-malaysias-net-profit,"2019-05-01 20:05:38"

(March 21, RM5.33)
Maintain hold with a target price (TP) of RM6: To recap, CIMB’s Target 2018 (T18) initiatives focused on becoming leaner and strengthen core areas like small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), digital consumer and transaction banking. CIMB was unsuccessful in meeting some of the 2018 financial goals that it originally set out to achieve four years ago — had the ambition to generate more than 15% return on equity (ROE) and about 50% cost-to-income ratio (CIR) but only posted 9.6% and 52.6% respectively. Despite the misses, it showed good progress between 2014-18 where the ROE inched up 30 basis points (bps) while CIR fell 6.5 percentage points (ppts). As for capital position, CIMB chalked in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 12.6%, realising its >11% target. 
The primary objective of CIMB’s Forward23 blueprint is to pursue growth via top line, anchoring on Malaysia and Indonesia markets (both combined to more than 80% of profit before tax [PBT]). CIMB is looking to increase productivity, customer experience, and sales, aside from leveraging on the foundation built by T18; these include: (i) digitisation efforts, (ii) data analytics, (iii) personalised services and (iv) form strategic partnerships. To benchmark, it has outlined three financial targets for 2023 — (i) raise ROE to 12-13%, (ii) bring CIR down to 45%, and (iii) maintain CET1 ratio at 13%.While we laud all of the initiatives that CIMB is taking on over the next five years, we are of the view that its 2023 financial aspirations are stretched, particularly CIR and ROE. Unlike T18, which has some controllable element to ensure a certain degree of success, Forward23 is partly dependent on external support like economic climate.Assuming a cost base inflation of 3%, our calculations indicated total income has to grow at a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% in order to lower CIR to 45%. We note this is higher than the 3.8% revenue CAGR, CIMB booked from 2014-18.For ROE to climb to 12-13%, CIMB must grow earnings at a much rapid pace (we estimate 10-11% per annum with 50% dividend payout and 80% reinvestment rate) or find ways to reduce its equity position. We believe both are difficult tasks as CIMB has to contend with a myriad of factors like (i) preserving net interest margin (NIM), (ii) lifting average loans growth, (iii) keeping operations expenditure and credit cost low, and (iv) look to up cash dividends.No changes to 2019-20 earnings forecasts. Introduced 2021 estimates while premised on 1.04 times 2019 price-to-book (P/B) ratio with 9.3% ROE, 9% core operating earnings and 3% long-term growth. This is in line with its five-year mean of 1.08 times but below the sector’s 1.18 times. The discount is fair given lower ROE generation, which is 1ppt beneath industry average. At current levels, the stock’s risk-reward profile remains balanced. Although CIMB is trading close to -1 standard deviation to its five-year mean P/B and price-to-earnings ratios, we reckon there is still scope for 2020-21 earnings downgrade by the street (too bullish with their projections but we are already 3-8% more conservative versus them). — Hong Leong Investment Bank, March 21",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cimb-staging-new-leg-growth-over-next-five-years,"2019-05-01 20:05:38"

He then handed the top position at the family-controlled conglomerate to his eldest son.Twelve months later, Victor Li, 54, has learned a tough lesson about being the follow-up act to a legendary figure in Hong Kong and investors have been pretty unforgiving so far.The stock price of the family’s flagship company, CK Hutchison, has dropped 17 percent in the year since Li Ka-shing announced his retirement. During that time, the benchmark Hang Seng Index has fallen 7.7 percent.“Li Ka-shing has been a unique asset of the family group, which unfortunately is not transferable to the next generation,” said Joseph Fan, a Chinese University of Hong Kong professor who specializes in family-run businesses.The elder Li, now 90, started out as a refugee and built a fortune that made him the city’s richest man, earning him a reputation among local residents as a deal maker on par with the likes of Warren Buffett.Younger LeadershipNow, it’s show time for Victor Li. The fitful transition at CK Hutchison is emblematic of a broader shift occurring at Hong Kong’s top family-run companies as billionaire founders make way for younger leadership.The next tycoon to step aside may be Henderson Land Development Co. Chairman Lee Shau Kee, the city’s second-richest man. Lee, 91, is considering retiring and having sons Lee Ka Kit and Lee Ka Shing take over, the company said in a stock exchange filing Wednesday.Even as CK Hutchison’s profit has jumped, Victor Li’s attempt to put his stamp on the group’s future has led to some setbacks abroad, with the group retreating from several high-profile deals. Closer to home he has moved cautiously, focusing on redeveloping properties and leaving untouched a board of directors composed largely of old-timers.“There’s not much change. It’s just having an extra title,” Li said at a Hong Kong press conference on Thursday following the announcement that CK Hutchison income rose 11 percent in 2018 to HK$39 billion ($5 billion), on a 9 percent gain in sales to HK$453 billion.With the retirement of his father, nicknamed Superman by the local media, the younger Li has yet to win over investors who doubt he has the same magic touch, according to Richard Harris, Hong Kong-based chief executive officer of Port Shelter Investment Management.“CK Hutchison’s shares used to have a Superman premium,” Harris said. “When Superman retired, things became boring.”That’s not for lack of trying. The younger Li didn’t waste time seeking to reshape the family business: In June a consortium of the group’s companies offered A$13 billion ($9.3 billion) for APA Group, an Australian operator of gas pipelines. The price tag represented the biggest overseas acquisition offer in CK’s history.The deal imploded, with Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in November rejecting it as “contrary to the national interest.”Li took another hit when the group’s Canadian oil company, Husky Energy Inc., abandoned a C$2.75 billion ($2.1 billion) hostile takeover of MEG Energy Corp. Husky announced its plan in September and in January walked away after failing to win enough support from shareholders.Li’s ability to make deals abroad is suffering in part from his father’s decades of work cultivating relations with the Chinese leaders, according to CGS-CIMB Securities analyst Raymond Cheng. “Superman is seen as having close ties with the Chinese government, while Western countries are growing skeptical of such backgrounds,” he said.At the press conference, Li defended the group’s overseas purchase plans, saying CK Hutchison today is seen as a global company although Hong Kong is its home. “We don’t feel excluded in other places in the world,” he said.Li has had victories closer to home. In July, the group disclosed a plan to redevelop Hutchison House, a stolid 1970s-era building in Hong Kong’s Central district. The new 490,000-square-foot building could double the project’s rental income when completed in 2023, with a value that could reach HK$35 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.“We’ll keep on doing Hong Kong property. It’s our main business,” Li said at the press conference.The Hutchison House project is one of several redevelopments of existing Hong Kong properties as Li devotes more attention to the group’s backyard, according to Morningstar Investment Service analyst Phillip Zhong.“He has a greater belief there are more opportunities in the Hong Kong property sector,” he said. “Because of the setback they had in Australia and improving sentiment here, there’s a shifting of the focus back to Hong Kong.”Long TenureIn the boardroom, Li is still largely working with his father’s team. The average age of members of CK Hutchison’s board of directors is more than 73, the oldest among companies on the Hang Seng Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average for index member companies is 61.Affiliates  CK Asset Holdings Ltd.,  CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. and  Power Assets Holdings Ltd. aren’t far behind, with all three ranking in the top 10 of the oldest boards of companies on the index. CK Hutchison declined to comment about board composition and corporate strategy.The news from abroad wasn’t all bad for Li. In June, CK Asset spent 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) to acquire the London headquarters of UBS Group AG. The group took control of mobile operator Wind Tre SpA by buying out its partner for 2.45 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in September.Li has slowly been building ties with Chinese tech companies by agreeing to deals with Ant Financial, Xiaomi Corp. and Meitu Inc. to sell smartphones, offer digital payments and provide other services in CK’s retail stores.“Victor didn’t make any major mistakes,” said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities Ltd. “We can’t expect everyone to work miracles.” - Bloomberg",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/li-kashings-son-stumbles-year-supermans-retirement,"2019-05-01 20:05:39"
278,"March 21, 2019 15:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Cover Story: CIMB takes the next step forward","With a jaunty gait and a bright smile, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz welcomes us into his office on the 30th floor of Menara CIMB in Kuala Lumpur Sentral.It is Monday, just days after CIMB announced record FY2018 earnings. The group CEO is none the worse for wear from having steered the country’s second largest banking group through a gruelling four years.The group made difficult decisions — for example, exiting investment banking in Australia and reducing headcount sizeably in Malaysia and Indonesia — as it looked to become more efficient and ultimately play catch-up with leading Asian peers under its T18 business plan.That four-year plan ended last year and CIMB was able to deliver on all but two of its key targets.Its FY2018 core net profit, minus one-off gains from divestments, grew 4% to RM4.66 billion, falling within analysts’ expectations. However, because of a weaker top line, CIMB missed a return-on-equity (ROE) target of 10.5% and a cost-to-income ratio (CIR) target of under 50%. These came in at 9.6% and 52.6% respectively.The CIR was nevertheless a solid improvement from 59.1% in FY2014. CIMB beat expectations on other key fronts like improving its CET-1 capital ratio to 12.6% and increasing consumer and commercial banking’s contribution to the group to 61% (see chart on page 72).“With T18, we showed that we can deliver [on tough targets]. I remember when we first launched T18 and met with investors, they were very sceptical. This was because, firstly, we had always been more of an investment/wholesale bank franchise and, secondly, we had driven expansion, so our cost growth has always been on the high side. Analysts laughed at us and, in fact, our share price tanked right after we announced the T18 plan because no one believed that we could deliver. But, slowly, we built up and we delivered,” Zafrul tells The Edge, clearly happy at having proved the critics wrong.This has given CIMB the confidence to now accelerate its growth. Forward23The group has just launched a new five-year business plan, Forward23, under which it has some ambitious targets to achieve by end-2023.“T18 was always about us narrowing the gap [with leading Asean banks] because we were so far behind. Now that we’ve done that, Forward23 is where we want to accelerate to become the top three to top five bank in the region, in terms of metrics like CIR, ROE, CET-1 ratio and profit before tax (PBT),” Zafrul says.According to him, over the last four years, CIMB’s improvements on these four fronts have outpaced those of most of its regional peers. By these measures, CIMB currently ranks somewhere in the middle-to-bottom of the top 13 regional banks, he says.CIMB is aiming for a CIR of 45%, CET-1 ratio of 13% and ROE of 12% to 13% by end-2023.With Forward23, CIMB wants to scale and accelerate growth in Malaysia and Indonesia; reposition and grow in Thailand, Singapore and Cambodia and, incubate and invest in Vietnam and the Philippines as well as go into new ventures.“The thinking behind Forward23 is that we want to accelerate growth in some of the markets and we want to future-proof as well to ensure that we are sustainable in the long run. Malaysia and Indonesia will be key. These two markets will contribute 80% of the incremental value [to the group] over the next five years,” Zafrul says.CIMB expects Indonesia’s PBT growth to increase 2.5 times in five years’ time, so its contribution to group PBT will be close to 35% compared with 20% in FY2018. Malaysia’s PBT, meanwhile, is seen growing 1.5 times.“In fact, we expect Malaysia’s contribution to group PBT to be only around 55% [from 64%], with 45% coming from our overseas markets. That’s not to say Malaysia is not growing, but the rest will be growing faster,” Zafrul says.“Repositioning” Thailand simply means the group will narrow its focus there, Zafrul says. “In the past years, we did everything from corporate, middle market, retail, all products. So we will streamline the business. For example, we have exited credit cards. We don’t need to be everything to everyone,” he explains.According to Zafrul, Forward23 is ultimately aimed at transforming CIMB into a different, more agile financial entity.The group will spend at least RM2 billion on technology-related investments over the next five years — double the amount spent on T18 — to protect or future-proof itself against growing disruption from non-bank players like fintechs.“The plan has always been to disrupt ourselves before others disrupt us. So, you will see that there will be a lot of changes in the way we do things over the next five years. We’re looking at the skillsets of our people and relooking the organisational structure because we want to be more agile,” he says.It is not like CIMB has a choice in the matter, he states matter-of-factly. The business of banking is changing so fast and CIMB needs to change its operating model to stay relevant.“We think that banks today, if we don’t change the way we operate, if the operating model doesn’t change, we’ll have difficulty achieving [the kind of growth we want]. As you well know, in these [challenging] markets, our margins are being compressed. Hence, if we just continue doing  what we are doing today, we will never get there,” Zafrul explains.Foward23 will revolve around the five pillars of customer, technology and data, people, ventures and partnerships as well as sustainability. New venturesAsked to elaborate on CIMB’s new ventures, Zafrul hints at mergers and acquisitions in the tech space.There are currently 48 players in the e-wallet space in Malaysia and Zafrul believes that “only three or four” will survive the intense competition.“You’ve seen the likes of Grab encroach into our system. They started off with ride hailing, then payment, e-wallet. So we need to be at the front end of that. We don’t want banks to be just another tool that other ecosystems use. We should be part of it. If not, our margins will continue to compress. We need to be as close as possible to the customer.”He says CIMB is not currently in talks with anyone but is eyeing a few prospects.“We, of course, have the benefit of Touch ‘n Go Sdn Bhd (TnG), which is doing quite well today,” he adds. TnG is 52%-owned by CIMB, with the rest of the equity held by UEM Group Bhd (20%) and MTD Capital Bhd (27.78%). In July 2017, TnG teamed up with Ant Financial, an affiliate of China’s Alibaba group, to roll out a mobile wallet ecosystem for Malaysians.“If you look at TNG Digital Sdn Bhd, it is now the No 1 player in Malaysia and we think we will do better this year, [especially] when we add new functions to that e-wallet sometime in the third quarter. We’ve overtaken the likes of Boost to become the No 1 player right now, with just over three million users already,” he shares.On the banking side, Zafrul says there are no plans for CIMB to embark on M&A in Malaysia under the five-year plan. It may, however, be opportunistic in markets like Thailand and Indonesia.“At home, I know there are a lot of rumours but we’re not looking at anyone. But in other countries, we’re more open,” he says.CIMB is currently present in all 10 Asean markets. “We’re still new in Vietnam and the Philippines, but Thailand, we’ve been there long enough, and we’re just barely in the top 10. To make a difference, you need to be at least top 5 to top 10, so Thailand is a market where we’ll be open to looking at. In Indonesia, we’re top 5 there, but you never know, we could be top 3,” Zafrul remarks.He says these markets make more sense to expand in. “Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines ... these three markets will have the largest delta, largest changes in terms of banking revenue over the next five years — over 10% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) compared with 4% to 5% in Malaysia.”Net interest margins in Indonesia’s banking sector are still above 5%, one of the highest in the world. No walk in the parkIt will not be easy for CIMB to get to where it wants. Growth in Malaysia’s economy is largely seen moderating over the next two years and there are still global uncertainties to contend with, like the US-China trade war and Brexit. Last year, the economy grew 4.7%, markedly down from 5.9% in 2017.Analysts also question whether CIMB can hit its CIR and ROE targets, considering the heavy investments it is making in technology alone.Zafrul admits it will be challenging. “You’re right, especially for Malaysia. There is some moderation in GDP growth — this year we’re forecasting around 4.5%, but the market is saying between 4% and 5%. But if you remember, during T18, there was also a period where we had some challenges, particularly in the region, with Brexit, the trade war and, before that, the Greek crisis. They did not directly impact Malaysia, but they did slow down our trade finance business.”There will be cycles over the five years, Zafrul says, but the key thing is for CIMB to monitor the situation closely and to stay agile.“Basically, we need to be realistic. If revenue is being challenged in a way that we don’t think we can reach that level [of growth that we want], we need to then invest slower. But, having said that, if you look at our markets outside Malaysia … in 2018, those were the markets that helped boost us. So, in a way, diversifying our revenue base does help. Indonesia’s earnings improved by 20% last year, Thailand improved by close to 100% and Singapore, 20%. So we’re still confident that these other markets will be doing better,” he says.There could also be improvements in its wholesale banking business. “You might find it hard to believe, but we have seen that wholesale banking is now back to normal. The volatility in capital markets is back ... so we are back to the normal run rate that we’ve seen before, albeit slightly slower than the years before. Last year was a really bad one for wholesale banking, so we think we will do better this year,” says Zafrul.PBT from wholesale banking — comprising corporate banking, treasury and markets as well as investment banking — fell 31.7% last year to RM1.75 billion.Consumer banking, however, fared well, with PBT growing 15.2% to RM2.96 billion. Its growth in key segments like mortgages, cards, automotive loans and CASA (current accounts and savings accounts) over the four years outpaced industry growth in Malaysia.  CIMB will continue to rely on those segments to drive growth, Zafrul says.The group has set a loan growth target of 6% for this year. In Malaysia, it expects loans to grow between 6% and 7%, higher than the 5% analysts are projecting for the industry. Jury still outAnalysts are mostly neutral on CIMB’s five-year plan for now.“The foundations have been laid under T18 and now it’s about them pushing hard on growth.  Since it will still continue to spend heavily on IT, where are the new revenue generators coming from, we’re not sure. We need to know more details,” an analyst with a local research house tells The Edge.Bloomberg data shows that of at least 23 analysts who track the stock, more than half (14) have a “hold” call, while eight have a “buy” and one, a “sell”.

279,"March 21, 2019 15:00 pm +08",CIMB,"Cover Story: ‘The board wants me to stay’","IN a candid two-hour interview with The Edge, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd group CEO Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz answers with ease questions on a wide range of topics. But there is an elephant in the room.We tentatively ask the question that is on the minds of many: Is he staying to see the group’s new five-year roadmap through or is he leaving?“Yes, I’m staying. I’ve always said it is up to the board to decide. Today [prior to this interview], there was a board meeting and they reiterated that they want me to stay to see Forward23 through,” he says.The Edge understands from industry sources that Bank Negara Malaysia recently approved the extension of his CEO tenure. Zafrul, 45, has been in the driving seat since Feb 27, 2015, although he had been acting group CEO since September 2014.Below is an excerpt from the interview. The Edge: CIMB is placed in a bit of dilemma, isn’t it? On the one hand, you need to spend to future-proof your business, but at the same time, the coming five years are not going to be easy. There’s been a change in government, there’s going to be transitional pain, people don’t know what kind of reforms will be implemented. So corporates are less willing to put in their money and therefore loans and deals could be short in coming.Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz: It is indeed challenging. But look, in that five years, there will be cycles. There will be ‘bumps’ along the road. It’s just a matter of how we, as a company, adjust to them. We are a multinational already today but, obviously, heavily skewed towards Malaysia contribution. But if we look at the next five years, the plan is to diversify that further, where we are truly an Asean multinational. So, having that PBT target mix of 55:45 (from Malaysia and overseas) for end-2023 is good. The targets that you’ve set for end-2023 seem ambitious. Other big banks like Public Bank are guiding for much more conservative growth in the near term.Yes, we have a loan growth target of 6% this year and we think we’ll grow higher than the market. But again, if you look at our net interest margin (NIM) today and the NIM compression that others are projecting, we are in a slightly different position because Malaysia is not as big a contributor [for us] as for other banks. So that helps.If you look at our NIM, it’s around 2+% and the rest is all around 1+%. It’s because in Indonesia, we’re still doing NIM of 5+%. It helps but, of course, our credit cost is slightly higher. And Indonesian loan growth is still in the double digits. I can’t just tell my guys in Indonesia to slow down when their industry is growing at 13% to 14%. So that’s why I’m trying to push the team to grow faster. You do seem to be banking on Indonesia a lot. But there are still many uncertainties — elections, potentially more rate hikes after the 175 basis point hike last year and the weak rupiah.The rupiah depreciation cost [us]around RM200 million in revenue last year, just on translation gains ... that was the other number that brought our revenue down. But, of course, it can work the other way for us if the rupiah improves! But yes, Indonesia is more volatile, but that also explains why NIM is double that of Malaysia’s — because when you look at the risk-adjusted return, that’s the kind of return that you get in markets where risk is higher. Big techs like Grab are making strides in the payment space. Debit and credit cards are being challenged. How do you intend to fight with these techs?On the payments side, at the end of the day, if you look at the economics behind the payment strategy, it’s not really there. These companies are doing it to acquire data as much as possible and then cross-sell to others, like how Ant Financial and WeChat are doing ... they try to cross-sell to their wealth management side, to their lending side. So we need to do the same.At the end of the day, we need to make sure that we mine our data properly, not just for customer experience but also for risk management, so that we can use the data to lend, to cross-sell other products. So, that’s what we’re doing. The next five years will see you continuing to invest heavily in technology, in digital. When do you think the fruits of all those investments will be seen?Today, across a few products, there’s a significant proportion of new sales being originated via digital channels. So definitely, it’s already starting to contribute and we will go one step further to say that our outperformance in Malaysia’s consumer banking over the last four years — the four key segments of mortgage, auto loans, cards and CASA (current account savings account) — was aided by data and digital.Now with data and digital, it’s so much more effective. We’re doing that a lot. So, the short answer to your question is, it’s already showing results and, definitely, we don’t have to wait 10 years. I think during the Forward23 period, that will become a much more material contributor. Are there more divestments on the cards?We are assessing that. We’re looking at all the business lines. These will continuously be monitored. Under Forward23, like T18, there are no sacred cows. So, your stance on bank mergers and acquisitions at home is they are not on the cards under Forward23, but you’ll consider proposals that come your way?Yes. Proposals come all the time. But, there’s no compelling reason for us to do bank M&A in Malaysia. Unless you can show us a merger that has the right kind of synergies, but at the same time, the right kind of valuation. Our shareholders will always be sensitive to valuation. And even if the merger makes sense, but at what price? Today, where we are in terms of our journey ... are we at the right time, the right place, the right valuation to do such things? Your 27% shareholder Khazanah Nasional has indicated that it plans to exit. That could trigger an M&A, no?They’ve said they categorise us as a ‘commercial’ investment ... which means that it is not strategic. At the right time or at the right price, they will look at disposing of some of it. Basically, from my understanding, they are not in a rush to do it ... so it can be today, it can be two, three, five years, right? I don’t think there will be any [merger]. The banking sector is continuing to change fast and remains very challenging. Some developed markets are talking about a recession. Italy, for example, is already in one. Against this backdrop, what do you see as your biggest challenges going forward?For us, the biggest challenge will be in Malaysia. Being a key market, it will be important for us at least for the next two to three years as it will still continue to generate more than half of our profits. But if you look at the Malaysian economy, it’s really, firstly, determined by what’s happening globally ... that’s the nature of an open economy. And two, we are sure there are many policies being formulated that would be a further catalyst for the economy.We can understand why the government is in a consolidating mode — it’s because it needs to fix certain things. But I think it has to be parallel to a growth strategy.If you look at the region, the other markets are expected to do quite well. Having said that, even 4.5% growth [in Malaysia] is still respectable. But, we need to look at where we are versus our peers in this region. And they are all looking at growing strongly, especially in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.We can’t do anything about the global uncertainties but we can do something to make sure that the companies and the government all focus on building the competitive edge that we have as a country. CIMB’s performance is closely correlated to the GDP growth of the countries in which we operate.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-board-wants-me-stay,"2019-05-01 20:05:40"

That implies a 10% to 16% return from Friday’s close.Malaysian stocks have bucked the global rally this year, losing more than 3% in 2019 while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11%. An economic growth slowdown and uncertainty over the new administration’s policies led to US$4.4 billion of equity outflows in the past 12 months.Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has shown signs of moving away from his earlier budget-cutting stance to revive large state projects and seek foreign investments. Malaysia struck a deal with China to resume the East Coast Rail Link at a lower cost and revived the US$34 billion property and transport hub Bandar Malaysia.“Fiscal stimulus, per resurrection of ECRL and Bandar Malaysia projects, is returning, oil prices are exceeding target and liquidity is ample,” the bank said in the report. “Government policy-centric catalytic news flow alone could allow the KLCI to recover to 12-month highs of 1,850.”Macquarie expects similar developments to happen with MRT 3 and the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail project, as well as in the telecom sector and within the Petroliam Nasional Bhd group of companies.The KLCI is showing some signs of a revival.

Maintain hold with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.15: CapitaLand Malaysia Mall Trust’s (CMMT) core net profit (CNP) for the first financial quarter of 2019 (1QFY19) of RM32.5 million (-12.8% year-on-year [y-o-y]) was slightly below our and consensus’ expectations. Overall decrease in 1QFY19 was mainly due to lower contributions from its Klang Valley malls, but partially mitigated by higher rental rates achieved from Gurney Plaza (GP) and East Coast Mall (ECM). 
We cut our forecasts slightly and is reflected in annual report figures which show a revised earnings per share (EPS) for 2019 and 2020 to -3.5% and -7.5% respectively. Following the dovish tone by major central banks and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), we revise our 10-year Malaysian Government Securities yield assumption to 3.9% (from 4.1%) and roll forward valuation to mid financial year 2020 (FY20).We maintain a “hold” call with an unchanged TP of RM1.15 based on the targeted yield of 6% (from 6.2%).CMMT’s 1QFY19 revenue of RM87.9 million (+1.1% quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q], -2% y-o-y) translated into a CNP of RM32.5 million (+0.6% q-o-q, -12.8% y-o-y). The results were slightly below our and consensus’ expectations with 23.4% and 22% respectively. The deviation was due to lower-than-expected revenue contribution.Q-o-q, total revenue for 1QFY19 of RM87.9 million increased by 1.1% compared with RM86.9 million in the previous quarter.CNP also increased by 0.6% to RM32.5 million from RM32.3 million in 4QFY18. The increase was thanks to improved performance from GP and ECM. CMMT incurred RM14.4 million capital expenditure during the quarter, mainly attributed to the Jumpa (the annex building of Sungei Wang (SW) with 170,000 sq ft of net lettable area) retail layout design and reconfiguration works at SW, enhancement works on the F&B area at The Mines (TM) and tenancy works at ECM.Y-o-y, RM87.9 million revenue decreased (-2%), followed by a decrease of CNP to RM32.5 million (-12.8%). The decline was mainly due to lower revenue caused by (i) lower occupancy rate at SW, TM and 3 Damansara, (ii) lower rental rates and downtime from asset enhancement initiative (AEI) works at SW and TM, and (iii) absence of a one-off forfeiture of deposit and compensation of premature termination of a mini anchor tenant at SW in 1QFY18.Nevertheless, the decrease was slightly mitigated by the improved performance from GP and ECM upon completion of its AEI works, and full occupancy attained at Tropicana City Office Tower.Finance costs were higher by 1.5%, given the increased average cost of debt post overnight policy rate hike as well as higher interest expenses from additional debt drawn down for capital expenditure works. Average cost of debt for 1QFY19 stood at 4.47% (1QFY18: 4.44%).Occupancy rate dropped slightly to 92.5% (FY18: 93.2%), while gearing increased slightly to 33.8% (FY18:32.5%).Jumpa began its AEI works since 2Q18 and it is expected to be completed by end of the first half of 2019. It is scheduled for a soft opening in 3Q19. To date, Jumpa has advanced leasing negotiations that exceeds 50%.We cut our earnings forecasts slightly as well as updated our projection based on FY18 audited account.

We understand and accept the importance of this connectivity,” he said in a special interview in conjunction with the one-year anniversary of the Pakatan Harapan government administration at his office in Wisma Angkasapuri today.According to Gobind, the proposal had been discussed with the Minister of Housing and Local Government (Zuraida Kamaruddin), and there were suggestions to ensure all buildings in new development projects, be it residential or office, be equipped with Internet access.Meanwhile, Gobind also drew attention to efforts by his Ministry to lower the Internet service charges so that everyone would have similar access to world technology with global-standard Internet speed and benefit various sectors, like agriculture, farming, medical, transport and e-commerce projects.“In Malaysia, there is no official Internet speed limit for the people that we can say that we have successfully created a good infrastructure. Unofficially, we have 30 mps, and at the time, we set it, how do we reach that level and at the same time reduce the cost of broadband.“So, when we introduce new prices under the National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP), we’ll see that the broadband price reducing. Prices have gone down in some cases, almost more than half. But on average among four telcos, it has come down almost at 50 percent,” he said.Among the main objectives of the NFCP existence is to achieve a baseline of 98 percent broadband coverage in inhabited areas by 2023, with a minimum broadband speed of 30 mbps so that 5G can be effectively implemented nationwide, especially in remote areas.Meanwhile, asked about reports his Ministry received regarding Internet and speed, Gobind said although he had announced the ministry’s objectives, it would still take time to be fully implemented.“We already have the data and we have found ways to solve it. We need to take some time. Of course there are efforts being implemented in the improvement process. For example, for Streamyx, we have discussed with TM.“It’s just that it’s not time yet to make an announcement. In two to three weeks’ time, hopefully we can make an announcement and resolve all these problems as fast as we can,” he added.Gobind said Internet and connectivity were among his main focus in ensuring that the infrastructure was enjoyed and utilised and that all the problems arising, such as cost and speed, had been resolved since he took over the ministry 11 months ago.“The 5G (Fifth Generation) pioneer project is a part of that (objective). It is also linked with the expansion of NFCP, which is related to infrastructure and bringing about change.“We must accept the fact that 10 to 20 years ago, that technology may have been key, but today the speed is slow, not reaching the level it should. Because of that, through NFCP, we focus on overcoming this problem and also build a more effective network system,” he said.He stressed that the connectivity factor was crucial in giving the public access to various information and future success, apart from increasing knowledge in all fields related to their lives.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/internet-connectivity-be-listed-utility-%E2%80%94-gobind,"2019-05-01 20:05:55"

This means investors should be looking for stocks that have good growth prospects or strong fundamentals.“If the [share] price is attractive and [the company’s] growth [prospects] are good, then it will serve as a buying opportunity,” he added.The FBM KLCI fell to a fresh two-year low last Thursday, closing at 1,624.23 points, as heightened concerns over slower global economic growth prompted investors to seek refuge in safe havens. The benchmark index inched up 5.94 points or 0.37% to close at 1,630.17 last Friday.Last week’s downward revision of the 2019 global growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund to 3.3% from 3.5% did not help matters. The fund had earlier this year revised down its growth forecast from 3.6%.Nomura head of equity research for Malaysia Tushar Mohata agrees that now is not the right time to turn to defensive stocks.That is because the defensive stocks on Bursa Malaysia have underperformed their Asean counterparts “significantly” due to strong outflows from foreign portfolio investors, he said.According to last Monday’s fund flow report by MIDF Research, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, foreign funds have sold RM1.76 billion net of local equities. Among the four Asean markets (Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines) it monitors, Malaysia has now surpassed Thailand to become the nation with the largest foreign net outflow.“Investors may want to consider looking at high beta stocks, which are trading at steep discount to their long-term average trading multiples. The near-term catalysts of these stocks could be improving earnings momentum,” said Tushar.He believes that these high beta stocks are likely to rally when Bursa reverses course and outperforms its peers in Asean.His top picks are CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd.For investors who want exposure to defensive sectors, Tushar pointed out that real estate investment trusts (REITs) are one due to their stable yield.RHB Research Institute head of Malaysian research Alexander Chia said for domestic investors that need to remain invested in local equities, the preservation of capital will be a key priority.“Adding some defensive names to one’s portfolio continues to make tactical sense, given the prevailing risks that are still unfolding. These companies should have strong earnings resilience that can ride through market upheavals,” he added.Chia is recommending stocks such as Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Mynews Holdings Bhd, Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd and QL Resources Bhd.However, in the short term, Chia said investors should be aware of the persistent selling by foreign portfolio investors and hence, be wary of stocks with large foreign shareholdings.He also noted that only large-cap stocks have underperformed this year, while small-cap stocks have performed well.YTD, the FBM Small Cap Index has risen 18.29% to close at 13,365.62 points last Friday, while the KLCI has fallen 3.57%.Noting that it is a trading market now, Chia said funds need to make money and achieve alpha or active returns on their investments.“The market is now very short-term and the valuation [of Malaysian stocks] is not that cheap even at current levels,” he added.Hence, he opined that investors should look for pockets of opportunity, beaten down stocks, value buys and undervalued stocks. Silver lining in defensive stocksWhile current market conditions have not been really positive and it is seen that even defensive stocks have been underperforming so far this year, analysts still see some silver lining in defensive stocks.UOB Kay Hian Malaysia research head Vincent Khoo expects defensive stocks to underperform the broader market in the near term, as the government steps up fiscal stimulus activities via megaprojects.This is also to respect the sanctity of government contracts, especially pertaining to its proposed acquisition of Gamuda’s highways, he said.“In such a scenario, we foresee improved investor confidence and foreign equity flows turning positive,” he added.However, there are still some defensive stocks which continue to have modest appeal and these include high dividend yielders such as IGB REIT and Magnum Bhd.Khoo said stocks that will continue to remain attractive include selective beneficiaries of megaprojects and trade diversion.Meanwhile, stocks to avoid include selective glove manufacturers as clarity on demand and supply dynamics is needed; selective technology companies on the back of anticipated weak first quarter of 2019 results season; and Telekom Malaysia Bhd where UOB Kay Hian will need to assess the magnitude of its fall in broadband access average revenue per user.MIDF Research head Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman is of the view that defensive stocks can still be a safe haven when it comes to consumer consumption and dividend play.In relation to consumption, he noted that the distributive trade was still growing at 6.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) in February, albeit moderating from 7.8% y-o-y in the previous month, due to a shorter month and the festive holidays.Retail growth was 8.5% y-o-y, while wholesale and motor vehicles grew 5.8% y-o-y and 2.4% y-o-y respectively.“This shows consumption remains strong among Malaysians,” said Redza.He said stocks with “still strong earnings”, coupled with stable dividend payments, should also be considered amid these trying times.“Companies with strong earnings would provide a stable flow of future dividends and with market sentiment negatively affecting the price movements, this could present a good opportunity to accumulate stocks with high dividend yields.“So, investors shouldn’t just look at historical dividend payments alone; they also have to look at the defensiveness of the companies’ profits,” he added.MIDF Research is recommending stocks such as DiGi.Com Bhd, MBM Resources Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and UOA Development Bhd.Despite concerns over a potential cut in the overnight policy rate by Bank Negara Malaysia, which may negatively impact banks’ profitability, Redza also likes CIMB and Malayan Banking Bhd, noting that their share prices have fallen a lot over the past year.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/when-defensive-stocks-are-no-longer-bearmarket-safe-haven,"2019-05-01 20:05:56"

307,"March 29, 2019 14:00 pm +08",TM,"Special Report: Saving Malaysia Airlines, again","SHOULD the government choose to shut it down, Malaysia Airlines Bhd will go down as the first national airline in Asia to go bust (Japan Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after two years), joining the ranks of its European counterparts such as Sabena, Air Berlin, Alitalia and Cyprus Airways.The flag carrier, which saw Khazanah Nasional Bhd pay RM1.38 billion to take it private in August 2014 and reboot it into a smaller airline under its current name in September 2015, is once again facing an uncertain future after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad remarked last week that shutting it down was one option being considered by the government. Selling the national asset and refinancing its debts are two other possibilities the government will explore, he said.The prime minister’s warning comes as calls for the beleaguered airline to be wound down intensified in the past few weeks. The airline’s woes flared up on March 5 after its sole shareholder Khazanah reported its first annual loss in over a decade, mainly due to a RM3.7 billion writedown of Malaysia Airlines’ value last year.It doesn’t help matters that the airline missed its target to return to the black last year and, according to Centre for Aviation (CAPA) chief analyst and chief representative for Southeast Asia Brendan Sobie, will find it difficult to achieve profitability, at least in the near future, given current market conditions.On March 1, the private company revealed that it finished 2018 with a marginally lower loss compared to a year ago but it did not disclose the figures.Filings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) show that Malaysia Airlines’ net loss increased by 85% year on year to RM812.11 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY2017). It has lost RM2.35 billion between 2015 and 2017.While it did not disclose its exact revenue for FY2018 except to say that it grew by 1% y-o-y, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that revenue rose to RM8.76 billion from RM8.67 billion in FY2017. It has yet to file its financial statements for FY2018 with SSM.Malaysia Airlines blamed FY2018’s poor performance on crew shortage, intense competition, oversupply of capacity and volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange.It is worth noting that when the 12-point MAS Recovery Plan (MRP) was conceived in 2014, fuel price was US$75.68 per barrel. As at March 8, 2019, the International Air Transport Association jet fuel price monitor was up 3.5% at US$80.30 per barrel from a year ago.The ringgit had also weakened by 3.6% to 4.9% to 4.0910 against the US dollar last Thursday. Khazanah’s assumption under the five-year recovery plan was that the local currency would range from 3.90 to 3.95.Still, critics point to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, which turned things around with a HK$2.3 billion profit last year after three years of heavy losses and Singapore Airlines (SIA), which managed to turn in a net profit of S$284 million for the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, amid the challenging operating environment. Khazanah seen more willing to give up the flag carrierAfter not one but four failed attempts at restructuring the national carrier and setting it on a path to sustainable profitability, including during the 42 years when it was known as Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), the calls are growing louder for the government to shut it down for good.Its weak financial health — even after a RM6 billion injection from Khazanah in 2014 — also makes it a prime target when Malaysia’s new government is looking to trim its huge debt of RM1.087 trillion as at Dec 31, 2018.Indeed, some analysts say the timing of Khazanah’s RM3.7 billion impairment charge on Malaysia Airlines in 2018 is an indication that it may be ready to end or sell its loss-making unit.HLIB Research aviation analyst Daniel Wong notes that Malaysia Airlines is not part of Khazanah’s core portfolio, suggesting that the state investment firm would be willing to part with its airline business if the investment does not make financial sense and assuming government approval is granted.“While we do not doubt Malaysia Airlines is a pride to Malaysia as the national carrier has been around since 1947, we remain doubtful of Khazanah’s willingness and ability to sustain the continued losses of Malaysia Airlines. The losses of Malaysia Airlines may amount to RM1 billion per year,” he says in a March 13 report. Malaysia Airlines can still fly highOnce-troubled flag carriers such as British Airways (BA), Japan Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Qantas Airways are living proof that Malaysia Airlines still has a chance of turning around, says a senior aviation consultant who declined to be named.A multitude of factors have contributed to Malaysia Airlines’ financial woes, but foremost among them is the lack of autonomy to run the business without government intervention, say airline experts and analysts.“There are no obvious or easy solutions and there are so many external factors that will impact Malaysia Airlines’ future financials. However, there are areas for potential improvement,” CAPA’s Sobie tells The Edge.“While the latest restructuring went much deeper than previous attempts, it didn’t go deep enough and address all the legacy issues. The airline could potentially take another crack at reducing its costs but this can only be effective if there is no political interference.“It could also relook its commercial and network strategy. Evolving into more of a regional airline could be an option,” he says.Sobie points out that while shutting down the airline is obviously politically difficult and has never really been an option, it now seems that it is being seriously considered.“There would still be sufficient competition in the market (even with Malaysia Airlines gone) and the void would likely be filled by the existing or new competitors. Keep in mind there were only two (Malaysia-based) players (Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia Group Bhd) before Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd was launched five years ago. However, another restructuring would still likely be the preferred option politically,” he adds.Transport infrastructure consultancy Modalis Infrastructure Partners associate director Khair Mirza believes Malaysia Airlines can thrive given a level playing field.“By definition, GLCs (government-linked companies) need to play a dual role. So, as long as it has a level playing field against other carriers, it can succeed, like how Qantas, Turkish Airlines and Garuda have all succeeded,” he adds.Khair points out that Malaysia Airlines is the only recognised strategic GLC that faces unfettered competition while trying to balance a social equity role. “It’s like asking an elephant to climb up a coconut tree just because the monkey has glorified climbing trees.”Meanwhile, a senior aviation consultant notes that the government must also ensure that Malaysia Airlines has the right people on its board of directors to steer the airline.“The board has had many of the same members for several years despite losses. It is good to have new people with fresh ideas to help move Malaysia Airlines forward.“It is also good to have a combination of some with overall airline industry experience (at least two to three years) and some good professionals in finance and law,” he adds.The consultant also points out that the airline must have the right people in senior management. “Malaysia Airlines CEO Izham Ismail should be given a chance to carry on and he deserves the freedom to name his own team,” he says.Modalis’ Khair concurs, noting that a shake-up of the eight-member board is long overdue.He also believes that it is time to allow Malaysia Airlines to award contracts based on competitive bidding rather than “giving contracts to non-strategic investees that have bloated into public-listed entities, squeezing out bona fide market participants”. A case in point is the RM42.99 million three-year contract bagged by UEM Edgenta Bhd’s 80%-owned subsidiary KFM Holdings Bhd in June 2016 to provide facility management services to Malaysia Airlines via direct negotiation.A check on Malaysia Airlines website reveals that its board comprises one executive director —  Izham — and seven non-executive directors, namely Tan Sri Krishnan Tan Boon Seng, Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, David Lau Nai Pek, Dr Mohamadon Abdullah, Sheranjiv M Sammanthan, Mohammad Izani Ashari and Ahmad Zulqarnain Che Onn. Foo Shiou Voon is an alternative director for Mohammad Izani.Tan, Lau, Mohamadon and Mohammad Izani have been on the board since August 2015. Tan, Lau and Mohamadon were also directors at the old MAS.An accountant by training, Tan is currently non-executive deputy chairman of IJM Corp Bhd. Zamzamzairani served as the group CEO and managing director of Telekom Malaysia Bhd from April 2008 to April 2017, while Lau has over 35 years of experience in finance and is also a director of Axiata Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Mohamadon had served MAS for 32 years before retiring on Dec 31, 2004, as senior general manager of corporate services.Meanwhile, four board members — Sheranjiv, Mohammad Izani, Ahmad Zulqarnain and Foo — are Khazanah appointees. Asset sales may offer some reliefHLIB Research’s Wong believes it will be wise for the government to divest Malaysia Airlines or find a strategic partner instead of shutting it down, which will stem the draining of government cash while reducing staff layoff, as the takeover entity will still need a workforce to run the airline.Malaysia Airlines has undergone two rounds of layoffs in the last 13 years. It shed over 6,000 employees in 2006 and 2007 under the Business Turnaround Plan 1 and another 6,000 in 2015 under the MRP. Today. it has a 13,000-strong workforce, which some still consider bloated given its smaller network.A former Malaysia Airlines senior executive says the government should take a leaf from the sale of a 49.9% stake in national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd to Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.“There won’t be any government interference in the management of the business then.“The entire board and key personnel of Malaysia Airlines must also be replaced. They had the opportunity to revive the airline, but failed. Let others in the private sector (preferably Malaysian) to fix this. It can be done,” he says.“The problems in Malaysia Airlines are obvious; we need the ‘will’ to do it. The government needs to let go of the national airline and let the private sector run it entirely, just like BA and Iberia,” he adds.He is also of the view that Malaysia Airlines’ business units like cargo, engineering, flight catering, ground handling and the loyalty programme should be transformed from cost centres to profit centres where they are responsible for their own revenues, costs and resulting profits.“These units should be looked at as standalone businesses. They  can then grow and expand without being held back by the passenger business.”Malaysia Airlines’ FY2017 financial statements show that its cargo revenue stood at just RM551.27 million, a far cry from the RM1.66 billion reported in FY2013.Its engineering services business has also been scaled down from a world-renowned player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul market under MAS Aerospace Engineering to a purely self-supporting unit today. Airport handling and engineering services revenue stood at RM49.34 million in FY2017 compared with RM256.86 million in FY2013. Note:Following the publication of this story, UEM Edgenta Bhd has clarified that Malaysia Airlines Bhd had conducted an open tender process for the RM42.99 million three-year facility management services contract covering specific parts of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and its Kelana Jaya academy in Petaling Jaya, and not via direct negotiation as reported.The open tender process saw the participation of several facility management service providers including KFM Holdings Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of UEM Edgenta, UEM Edgenta said in a statement.It noted that Malaysia Airlines undertook a request for information in May 2015, followed by a request for proposal in July 2015 and commercial clarification.""In the final round, KFM along with two other facilities management service providers were shortlisted. KFM was informed of the contract award in February 2016 and it was completed in December 2018,"" it said.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/special-report-saving-malaysia-airlines-again,"2019-05-01 20:05:59"

As a result, MYTV saw its broadcasting services in several states suspended.On Feb 4, Green Packet issued a notice of arbitration to MYTV, seeking payment for the first batch of 200,000 STBs that were supplied to the latter, as well as for the company to take up the supply and delivery of the remaining 1.4 million STBs.Not many are aware of the dispute between the two companies as the announcement was somewhat hidden within Green Packet’s Feb 26 quarterly results announcement, under “material events subsequent to the end of the quarter”.Few details of the arbitration case were provided as the company did not make any separate announcement on material litigation.Green Packet merely said the notice of arbitration was issued pursuant to “Clause 42 of the agreement” dated Jan 23 last year, for the design, supply, assembly, testing and acceptance of DVB-T2 (T2000) STBs.Under the contract, purchase orders may be issued by MYTV to the contractor from time to time for the supply of up to 3.6 million STBs, provided that no further purchase orders will be issued after the expiry of two years.On Jan 23 last year, Green Packet announced that it had clinched a RM272 million contract to supply 3.6 million STBs to MYTV, a company that is controlled by tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary, which was awarded a concession by the government to operate the infrastructure and network facilities for digital terrestrial TV services.The orders were expected to help loss-making Green Packet — a communications and technology services firm founded by technopreneur Puan Chan Cheong in 2000 — to return to the black in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018).However, Green Packet’s turnaround plan seems to have hit a snag due to the contract dispute.“This contract was supposed to be a significant revenue contributor to Green Packet. But now, it seems like there will be no positive financial impact on the group until the dispute is resolved,” a senior media analyst tells The Edge.For perspective, purchase orders for 1.6 million STBs will be directly issued by MYTV, while the remaining two million STBs will be from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) in the form of back-to-back orders.Recall that MYTV was awarded the licence under the National Broadcasting Digitalisation Project to develop and manage the infrastructure and network facilities for digital terrestrial TV (DTT) services in Malaysia, in a move to migrate the country’s terrestrial broadcasting from analogue to digital. What went wrong?According to industry sources, MYTV appears to be running into financial difficulties, but the DTT project will proceed as the company is likely to source the STBs from other vendors.“Syed Mokhtar claimed that he had invested close to RM500 million (in MYTV), mainly to build the network and infrastructure, but the company somehow does not have enough money to execute the DTT project,” a source tells The Edge.The senior media analyst says MYTV is stuck in its current predicament because it is not investing enough in its business. “At one time, it was trying to get some vendors to finance the company,” the analyst adds.Although Green Packet stepped in to help MYTV to fast track the DTT project in January last year, the broadcasting firm is said to be facing some financial difficulties, and orders and payments were delayed.When contacted by The Edge, both Green Packet and MYTV declined to comment on the dispute. Court documents, meanwhile, are not publicly available as arbitration to resolve disputes is held behind closed doors.A check on the MYTV website shows that the company has commenced distribution of free decoder sets to Bantuan Sara Hidup Rakyat recipients nationwide until the end of this month.MYTV is responsible for developing a digital multimedia broadcasting hub and a network of high, medium and low-powered digital TV transmitters. The initiative is under the purview of the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia and monitored by MCMC.Overall, MYTV will be installing 60 main transmitters and 40 gap fillers to provide signal coverage to 98% of the population.Analogue switch-off (ASO) is the process by which older analogue TV broadcasting technology is converted to and replaced by digital TV.Switching to digital TV is necessary as the world migrates from analogue to digital broadcasting. Going digital will allow the government to free up frequency spectrum that can be used for higher quality and efficient mobile services.With DTT, a lower cost of capital expenditure can be expected as there is no need to lay hybrid fibre coaxial cables, rent additional transponders or launch new satellites. With the reduction of infrastructure costs, broadcasters will be able to concentrate their financial resources on producing content.Asean member countries have been collectively aiming for ASO in phases between 2015 and 2020. To ensure signal harmonisation, countries with interconnected borders, including Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei, have agreed to a 2018 ASO target.It is part of the national agenda to transform the country’s broadcasting industry through digitisation with the aim of improving living standards as the country gears up for developed nation status by next year.

310,"March 26, 2019 11:30 am +08",TM,"My Say: Policy certainty and investor confidence","There was a stir in the news flow when Khazanah Nasional Bhd’s financial results were released earlier this month. The fund posted its first loss in 15 years — a RM6.27 billion loss before tax in 2018 compared to a RM2.9 billion profit before tax in 2017. The losses were from impairments of some of its investments — a whopping RM7.3 billion. The more appropriate measure of its performance, however, and the more telling one, is the 21.6% drop in the net worth adjusted (NWA) of the portfolio from RM116 billion in 2017 to RM91 billion in 2018.A more detailed look shows that the value of Khazanah’s holdings in its two telcos alone, Axiata Group Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), lost RM8.5 billion in market capitalisation, while the drop in the share prices of Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (CIMB) and IHH Healthcare Bhd (IHH) contributed to the contraction of the NWA. Clearly, market sentiment towards these major Khazanah investee companies turned negative, resulting in the drop of their share prices. The share price of TM opened 2018 at above RM6 and closed the year at RM2.65, hitting a low of RM2.15 along the way. The FBM KLCI, by contrast, contracted only 3% in 2018.The explanation for the contraction of the NWA is a rather straightforward one. While overall market sentiments softened in 2018, the FBM KLCI still outperformed both the MSCI Global and Emerging Market indices. The 21.6% drop in Khazanah’s NWA is, therefore, peculiar to its holdings in selected companies — TM, Axiata, TNB, CIMB, IHH and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB). There were policy and regulatory changes in 2018 that affected these particular companies and, therefore, market sentiments towards them. Herein lies a larger issue.These same companies, all of them public companies, have other investors, institutional and retail, domestic and foreign. These investors too suffered the same losses as Khazanah. Major domestic institutional investors such as the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP) must have invested in these historically well-performing companies and they, too, will have suffered similar losses in value, which will affect both their portfolio values as well as the dividends they pay out to their respective subscribers.Beyond these domestic institutional investors, there are also foreign funds that invest in good performing Malaysian companies. They, too, will have invested in these same companies and they would have suffered the same losses. While some domestic institutional investors are constrained from investing in domestic markets, foreign investors are free to move to where the risk-weighted returns are the best. Some of them have exited our market, with net foreign fund outflow for 2018 totalling RM11.6 billion.What has happened is that policy and regulatory changes adversely affected market sentiments — not just for the specific companies but, more alarmingly, for the Malaysian market more generally. These sporadic bouts of policy changes would have been tolerated by investors if they were part of a broader policy shift that is well communicated and understood, but that is not the case.In the case of the telcos, policy and regulatory changes — on what should have been commercial decisions such as product design and pricing — seriously affected earnings forecasts and, therefore, investors’ valuations of the companies. The drop in share prices simply reflect that outlook. This is the kind of regulatory risks that investors are fearful of. They are capable of assessing companies’ operational efficiency as well as locating them properly within the industry landscape but it is regulatory risks that present a challenge and thus constitutes the larger bulk of risk.Changes in regulatory regimes that are seen as reacting to specific impetus without a broader coherence will just increase the risk profile of Malaysia as a whole. The Malaysian economy can ill-afford the increased risk profile. Our current account surplus has dwindled over the years, closing 2018 at barely 3% of gross domestic product, and it is not expected to improve given sluggish trade sentiments, while the need to borrow and refinance debts will continue. Portfolio outflows make things worse. Therefore, maintaining investors’ confidence and managing the country’s risk profile is of utmost importance.What is still missing at the policy level today is a big picture economic story — phrased positively in terms of what it is rather than what it is not. That will set a direction, a focal point for all other subsidiary stories. It will also identify the lynchpins of the story — the key economic imperatives that drive the whole story, among which, I reckon, is to protect investors’ confidence.Matters of policy relate to the boundary between the state and markets. What is the role of the government in the economy? From the perspective of the capital market, terms like government-linked companies (GLCs) should be properly used or its usage abandoned altogether. Policy and regulations cannot discriminate between GLCs and non-GLCs if a company, a public company, is deemed a GLC merely because statutory funds whose monies do not belong to the government, such as the EPF, PNB and Social Security Organisation (Socso) have shares in it. Are Sime Darby, Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB, Axiata and IJM Corp Bhd government-related companies?In the case of sectors where there used to be natural monopolies, such as utilities and airports, privatised public enterprises such as TNB, TM and Malaysia Airports may still have government holdings in the form of Khazanah shares in them, but these are publicly listed companies with sizeable private and even international investors, and they should neither be favoured nor made victims of policy or regulations.These are commercial entities and should be treated as such — treated by how they behave in the marketplace rather than according to their lineage or even the composition of their shareholders. Commercial disputes between companies, for example, should be matters resolved by the rule of law without the parentage of companies being taken into consideration, what more direct government intervention.The whole point of the Putrajaya Committee for GLC High Performance programme launched in 2004 was to improve the performance of the 20 publicly listed companies that had either significant holdings by statutory funds or a governmental legacy so that they are subjected to market discipline and their governance be made equally transparent.When the 10-year programme ended in 2015, the total shareholder return of these 20 companies grew at 11.1% annually and their aggregate market capitalisation increased from RM133.8 billion to RM386 billion — almost a three times multiple.Beyond that, the regulatory environment was improved mainly by clearly demarcating policy, which can get enmeshed with the political imperative of the government and regulation, which should be driven by promoting healthy competition to attract investors into industries. Empowering shareholders and the presence of regulators, independent of policymakers, create a rules-based environment, the kind of environment investors prefer.The problematic part of government’s presence in the economy are the numerous companies established by the various statutory bodies. There has been a proliferation of these companies. These are not government-linked companies, but outright government-owned, effectively state-owned enterprises (SOEs). They should be properly labelled and need some sort of rationalisation, and a major part of public sector reform should be a serious re-examination of the government’s use of non-governmental organisations — companies established under the Companies Act — as policy tools.The government has been using companies as policy tools in the form of SOEs to achieve bumiputera participation objectives but this approach has not worked. Compare this to the much better performance of funds such as PNB using the capital markets to invest and therefore support performing firms, but the firms they invest in should be treated neutrally by the regulations.These are not GLCs, certainly not SOEs, but public companies with a wide spectrum of investors whose collective performance defines the health of the country’s economy. Truth be told, PNB operating in the capital market has been more successful in achieving the bumiputera agenda objectives than most other policy tools.Clarity in these fundamental issues will create the right environment and the right incentives for investors to decide which enterprises to support and what, in their view, are potentially profitable ones. The government should have a facilitative and not a participative role. It should focus on providing policy clarity and regulatory certainty to attract investments. In order to obtain such an outcome, the government must first articulate a big picture story that sets a strategic direction understood by all interested parties.Nungsari A Radhi is an economist.

312,"March 22, 2019 18:07 pm +08",TM,"Why does Malaysia Airlines keep failing — and is there a way to stop it?","SHOULD the government choose to shut it down, Malaysia Airlines Bhd will go down as the first national airline in Asia to go bust (Japan Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after two years), joining the ranks of its European counterparts such as Sabena, Air Berlin, Alitalia and Cyprus Airways.The flag carrier, which saw Khazanah Nasional Bhd pay RM1.38 billion to take it private in August 2014 and reboot it into a smaller airline under its current name in September 2015, is once again facing an uncertain future after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad remarked last week that shutting it down was one option being considered by the government. Selling the national asset and refinancing its debts are two other possibilities the government will explore, he said.The prime minister’s warning comes as calls for the beleaguered airline to be wound down intensified in the past few weeks. The airline’s woes flared up on March 5 after its sole shareholder Khazanah reported its first annual loss in over a decade, mainly due to a RM3.7 billion writedown of Malaysia Airlines’ value last year.It doesn’t help matters that the airline missed its target to return to the black last year and, according to Centre for Aviation (CAPA) chief analyst and chief representative for Southeast Asia Brendan Sobie, will find it difficult to achieve profitability, at least in the near future, given current market conditions.On March 1, the private company revealed that it finished 2018 with a marginally lower loss compared to a year ago but it did not disclose the figures.Filings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) show that Malaysia Airlines’ net loss increased by 85% year on year to RM812.11 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY2017). It has lost RM2.35 billion between 2015 and 2017.While it did not disclose its exact revenue for FY2018 except to say that it grew by 1% y-o-y, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that revenue rose to RM8.76 billion from RM8.67 billion in FY2017. It has yet to file its financial statements for FY2018 with SSM.Malaysia Airlines blamed FY2018’s poor performance on crew shortage, intense competition, oversupply of capacity and volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange.It is worth noting that when the 12-point MAS Recovery Plan (MRP) was conceived in 2014, fuel price was US$75.68 per barrel. As at March 8, 2019, the International Air Transport Association jet fuel price monitor was up 3.5% at US$80.30 per barrel from a year ago.The ringgit had also weakened by 3.6% to 4.9% to 4.0910 against the US dollar last Thursday. Khazanah’s assumption under the five-year recovery plan was that the local currency would range from 3.90 to 3.95.Still, critics point to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, which turned things around with a HK$2.3 billion profit last year after three years of heavy losses and Singapore Airlines (SIA), which managed to turn in a net profit of S$284 million for the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, amid the challenging operating environment. Khazanah seen more willing to give up the flag carrierAfter not one but four failed attempts at restructuring the national carrier and setting it on a path to sustainable profitability, including during the 42 years when it was known as Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), the calls are growing louder for the government to shut it down for good.Its weak financial health — even after a RM6 billion injection from Khazanah in 2014 — also makes it a prime target when Malaysia’s new government is looking to trim its huge debt of RM1.087 trillion as at Dec 31, 2018.Indeed, some analysts say the timing of Khazanah’s RM3.7 billion impairment charge on Malaysia Airlines in 2018 is an indication that it may be ready to end or sell its loss-making unit.HLIB Research aviation analyst Daniel Wong notes that Malaysia Airlines is not part of Khazanah’s core portfolio, suggesting that the state investment firm would be willing to part with its airline business if the investment does not make financial sense and assuming government approval is granted.“While we do not doubt Malaysia Airlines is a pride to Malaysia as the national carrier has been around since 1947, we remain doubtful of Khazanah’s willingness and ability to sustain the continued losses of Malaysia Airlines. The losses of Malaysia Airlines may amount to RM1 billion per year,” he says in a March 13 report. Malaysia Airlines can still fly highOnce-troubled flag carriers such as British Airways (BA), Japan Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Qantas Airways are living proof that Malaysia Airlines still has a chance of turning around, says a senior aviation consultant who declined to be named.A multitude of factors have contributed to Malaysia Airlines’ financial woes, but foremost among them is the lack of autonomy to run the business without government intervention, say airline experts and analysts.“There are no obvious or easy solutions and there are so many external factors that will impact Malaysia Airlines’ future financials. However, there are areas for potential improvement,” CAPA’s Sobie tells The Edge.“While the latest restructuring went much deeper than previous attempts, it didn’t go deep enough and address all the legacy issues. The airline could potentially take another crack at reducing its costs but this can only be effective if there is no political interference.“It could also relook its commercial and network strategy. Evolving into more of a regional airline could be an option,” he says.Sobie points out that while shutting down the airline is obviously politically difficult and has never really been an option, it now seems that it is being seriously considered.“There would still be sufficient competition in the market (even with Malaysia Airlines gone) and the void would likely be filled by the existing or new competitors. Keep in mind there were only two (Malaysia-based) players (Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia Group Bhd) before Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd was launched five years ago. However, another restructuring would still likely be the preferred option politically,” he adds.Transport infrastructure consultancy Modalis Infrastructure Partners associate director Khair Mirza believes Malaysia Airlines can thrive given a level playing field.“By definition, GLCs (government-linked companies) need to play a dual role. So, as long as it has a level playing field against other carriers, it can succeed, like how Qantas, Turkish Airlines and Garuda have all succeeded,” he adds.Khair points out that Malaysia Airlines is the only recognised strategic GLC that faces unfettered competition while trying to balance a social equity role. “It’s like asking an elephant to climb up a coconut tree just because the monkey has glorified climbing trees.”Meanwhile, a senior aviation consultant notes that the government must also ensure that Malaysia Airlines has the right people on its board of directors to steer the airline.“The board has had many of the same members for several years despite losses. It is good to have new people with fresh ideas to help move Malaysia Airlines forward.“It is also good to have a combination of some with overall airline industry experience (at least two to three years) and some good professionals in finance and law,” he adds.The consultant also points out that the airline must have the right people in senior management. “Malaysia Airlines CEO Izham Ismail should be given a chance to carry on and he deserves the freedom to name his own team,” he says.Modalis’ Khair concurs, noting that a shake-up of the eight-member board is long overdue.He also believes that it is time to allow Malaysia Airlines to award contracts based on competitive bidding rather than “giving contracts to non-strategic investees that have bloated into public-listed entities, squeezing out bona fide market participants”. A case in point is the RM42.99 million three-year contract bagged by UEM Edgenta Bhd’s 80%-owned subsidiary KFM Holdings Bhd in June 2016 to provide facility management services to Malaysia Airlines via direct negotiation.A check on Malaysia Airlines website reveals that its board comprises one executive director —  Izham — and seven non-executive directors, namely Tan Sri Krishnan Tan Boon Seng, Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, David Lau Nai Pek, Dr Mohamadon Abdullah, Sheranjiv M Sammanthan, Mohammad Izani Ashari and Ahmad Zulqarnain Che Onn. Foo Shiou Voon is an alternative director for Mohammad Izani.Tan, Lau, Mohamadon and Mohammad Izani have been on the board since August 2015. Tan, Lau and Mohamadon were also directors at the old MAS.An accountant by training, Tan is currently non-executive deputy chairman of IJM Corp Bhd. Zamzamzairani served as the group CEO and managing director of Telekom Malaysia Bhd from April 2008 to April 2017, while Lau has over 35 years of experience in finance and is also a director of Axiata Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Mohamadon had served MAS for 32 years before retiring on Dec 31, 2004, as senior general manager of corporate services.Meanwhile, four board members — Sheranjiv, Mohammad Izani, Ahmad Zulqarnain and Foo — are Khazanah appointees. Asset sales may offer some reliefHLIB Research’s Wong believes it will be wise for the government to divest Malaysia Airlines or find a strategic partner instead of shutting it down, which will stem the draining of government cash while reducing staff layoff, as the takeover entity will still need a workforce to run the airline.Malaysia Airlines has undergone two rounds of layoffs in the last 13 years. It shed over 6,000 employees in 2006 and 2007 under the Business Turnaround Plan 1 and another 6,000 in 2015 under the MRP. Today. it has a 13,000-strong workforce, which some still consider bloated given its smaller network.A former Malaysia Airlines senior executive says the government should take a leaf from the sale of a 49.9% stake in national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd to Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.“There won’t be any government interference in the management of the business then.“The entire board and key personnel of Malaysia Airlines must also be replaced. They had the opportunity to revive the airline, but failed. Let others in the private sector (preferably Malaysian) to fix this. It can be done,” he says.“The problems in Malaysia Airlines are obvious; we need the ‘will’ to do it. The government needs to let go of the national airline and let the private sector run it entirely, just like BA and Iberia,” he adds.He is also of the view that Malaysia Airlines’ business units like cargo, engineering, flight catering, ground handling and the loyalty programme should be transformed from cost centres to profit centres where they are responsible for their own revenues, costs and resulting profits.“These units should be looked at as standalone businesses. They  can then grow and expand without being held back by the passenger business.”Malaysia Airlines’ FY2017 financial statements show that its cargo revenue stood at just RM551.27 million, a far cry from the RM1.66 billion reported in FY2013.Its engineering services business has also been scaled down from a world-renowned player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul market under MAS Aerospace Engineering to a purely self-supporting unit today. Airport handling and engineering services revenue stood at RM49.34 million in FY2017 compared with RM256.86 million in FY2013. Note:Following the publication of this story, UEM Edgenta Bhd has clarified that Malaysia Airlines Bhd had conducted an open tender process for the RM42.99 million three-year facility management services contract covering specific parts of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and its Kelana Jaya academy in Petaling Jaya, and not via direct negotiation as reported.The open tender process saw the participation of several facility management service providers including KFM Holdings Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of UEM Edgenta, UEM Edgenta said in a statement.It noted that Malaysia Airlines undertook a request for information in May 2015, followed by a request for proposal in July 2015 and commercial clarification.""In the final round, KFM along with two other facilities management service providers were shortlisted. KFM was informed of the contract award in February 2016 and it was completed in December 2018,"" it said.For related story, see: Overcapacity sends Malaysia Airlines further into turbulence",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/why-does-malaysia-airlines-keep-failing-%E2%80%94-and-there-way-stop-it,"2019-05-01 20:06:01"

The power plant has a total capacity of 1,440 mW, comprising four generating units of 360 mW each.Mudajaya’s venture into the Indian power production industry goes as far back as in 2009, when it took up a 26% stake in RKM Powergen Pvt Ltd to undertake the construction of the power plant, with an estimated investment of RM5 billion.More than a year ago, it reduced its stake in the Indian independent power producer to 18.93% through disposing of its 7.07% stake in RKM to Apollo Ventures Co Ltd for US$19.5 million.Progressive Impact Corp Bhd has bagged a 109.22 billion rupiah (RM31.35 million) contract from Chevron Corp to undertake environmental sampling and laboratory analysis for its Sumatera operation in Indonesia.It said the award is a continuity of the existing business that its subsidiary PT ALS Indonesia has with Chevron. Additionally, the contract serves as a business expansion in a foreign market, that is, Indonesia, it added.Perdana Petroleum Bhd has secured a RM17.7 million contract from Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd to supply two units of accommodation work barges.It said the first work barges will be chartered for a period of 120 days with an extension option. The contract will begin on March 29.For the second work barges, it said will be chartered for 200 days with an option for a period of 15 + 15 days. The contract is effective from April 1.MCE Holdings Bhd has secured two contracts to supply various electronic and mechatronic components and parts for Proton and Perodua new car models.The Proton contract will generate total revenue of RM35 million over the nine-year period, while the estimated total investment cost to be incurred will be RM3.8 million.The Perodua project is expected to generate total revenue of RM16 million for MCE over the four-year period, while the estimated total investment cost is RM130,000.Proton, a 50.1%-owned by DRB-Hicom Bhd will collaborate with a local partner to establish a manufacturing assembly plant in Pakistan, its first in the South Asia region.The agreement was inked by Proton and its local partner, Alhaj Automotive last year.“This is significant because it will be Proton’s first (assembly) plant in South Asia and the population of Pakistan is 210 million,” said Malaysia High Commissioner to Pakistan Ikram Mohammad Ibrahim.Vizione Holdings Bhd said Wira Syukur (M) Sdn Bhd, a construction firm injected into Vizione for RM280 million — reported a profit after tax of RM57.33 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18) — has exceeded its profit guarantee by RM3.31 million.This brings Wira Syukur’s two-year net profit for FY17 and FY18 to RM85.91 million, exceeding the guarantee amount of at least RM82.59 million, it added.Plantation group United Malacca Bhd saw its net profit slide to RM2.36 million for the third quarter ended January 31, 2019 from RM10.29 million in the previous corresponding quarter, due to its adoption of the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards framework and lower average prices of crude palm oil and palm kernel.Excluding the impact of MFRS adoption, its pre-tax profit would be RM9.88 million, compared with RM3.3 million.Quarterly revenue fell 17% to RM53.48 million from RM64.44 million a year earlier. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tm-mudajaya-progressive-impact-perdana-petroleum-dayang-enterprise-mce-drbhicom-vizione-and,"2019-05-01 20:06:02"

Upgrade to market perform with a higher target price of RM3.10: Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) has revealed its intention to sell more buildings and land bank to unlock the value of its assets following a tender bid called for its two buildings (Annexe 1 and Annexe 2) recently, according to the local media. The intention to rationalise its non-core property assets came as no surprise to us given TM is consistently aiming to create long-term value for its shareholders via strengthening the balance sheet and focus the company’s portfolio on its core business that drives growth. 
TM has published a tender notice recently for the 20-storey TM Annexe 1 and the 33-storey Annexe 2, which are located next to Menara TM, and plans to close the submission on March 29. The two leasehold office towers have a combined gross floor area of 679,015 sq ft with a net lettable area of 468,772 sq ft. It has lately been reported that the reserve price range is between RM273 million and RM312 million, implying RM755-RM1,027 per sq ft, similar to the surrounding price offered based on our observation. While the net book value (NBV) of the said buildings is unknown for now, we understand that all its buildings and land as per its 2017 annual report were estimated to be RM3 billion, of which 30% (or RM877 million) was derived from value of land and 55% (or RM1.17 billion) from its buildings located in Kuala Lumpur.The disposal of two office blocks is expected to generate extra cash to TM, which could be utilised for capital expenditure or lowering debts. For illustration purposes, assuming the two office blocks are disposed of at their reserve price (RM585 million), coupled with half of its land unloaded at 20% higher than its 2017 NBV, TM’s balance sheet could potentially be strengthened by an additional RM1.1 billion in cash. Should all of the proceeds be utilised for lowering debts, financial year 2019 (FY19) gross debt/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ratio could be reduced to 2.2 times (compared with 2.5 times initially) with gearing of 0.6 times (compared with 0.8 times). However, we downplay the prospect of special dividend (arising from the proposed disposals) given the group is aiming to strengthen its cash position amid rising cost pressure and competition.While we make no changes to our FY19-FY20 estimated earnings for now, pending the outcome of the tender process, we believe TM is on the right track to enhance operational efficiency and strengthen its balance sheet via active asset management. — Kenanga Research, March 19",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tms-active-asset-management-move-seen-positive-step,"2019-05-01 20:06:04"
316,"March 20, 2019 09:48 am +08",TM,"Listing unlisted GLCs will improve operations — fund managers","KUALA LUMPUR: The government’s plan to list some of its matured unlisted entities is a good move albeit not a surprising one, which could drive these government-linked companies (GLCs) to operate more efficiently once they are put under public scrutiny, said fund managers.Moody’s Investors Service analyst Anushka Shah said the divestment of GLCs is not a new initiative, pointing out that it was the cornerstone of the 10-year GLC Transformation Programme which was concluded in 2015.“Listing GLCs may bring some benefits in terms of greater transparency and disclosure standards, achieving a greater balance between the public and private sectors, and better governance,” she told The Edge Financial Daily.Anushka, however, pointed out that asset divestments generally lack predictability.Speaking at the two-day Invest Malaysia conference yesterday, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia’s matured unlisted government entities may be listed on the stock market, with the government also looking into some of its shareholdings in GLCs, indicating that it may cut its stakes in certain listed companies.He said this is to ensure greater risk control parameters for issuances of government guarantees, better market access and identification of opportunities of potential asset monetisation, adding that GLCs will play “certain catalytic roles to support the economy”.MIDF Research head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman said corporatising GLCs could be a good move, seeing how Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) and Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (TNB) operations had transformed from their previous incarnations as Jabatan Telekom and Lembaga Letrik Negara respectively.“Looking at TM and TNB, from just being government departments previously, they have grown leaps and bounds in playing an active role in the development of the telecommunications and power sectors.“They [currently] finance their own capex (capital expenditure) needs without burdening the government’s coffers while providing opportunities to many entrepreneurs to join as vendors and resellers,” he said.In terms of potential candidates that could see a listing, Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng said there are many companies that could be candidates, based on the high number of companies under government-linked investment companies such as Khazanah Nasional Bhd and Permodalan Nasional Bhd.He added that units of Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) could also be potential candidates.However, Ang said, the GLCs that the government intends to list must be companies that investors are interested in, in order to get good value.“It must be something that investors want. If it is just listings for the sake of listings, the government will not get good valuation as people will not be interested to invest. The government has to see where the demand is in the market and then look at which companies it can list and sell at a good price,” he said.Astramina Advisory Sdn Bhd managing director Wong Muh Rong concurred that Petronas is a likely candidate, given that it is a world-class company with reputable governance, comparing it to Saudi Arabia’s national oil and gas company Saudi Aramco which is also planning an initial public offering in 2021.“The government does not need to let go of a substantial portion of its shareholdings as they can already raise a lot of funds just by monetising a 20% to 30% stake in Petronas.“Petronas is a good candidate. It is not difficult to sell and the government can get fairly good upfront money and use it to boost market activity,” said Wong.On the other hand, another fund manager, who declined to be named, said it is unlikely that an offer for Petronas would be on the table but noted that the government could start divesting its holdings in some of the relatively smaller companies first.“I don’t think the government will list Petronas as it is considered a strategic asset. They can still monetise [it] but maybe just a minority stake or a division under the group,” said the fund manager.He pointed to Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera’s portfolio which includes Affin Bank Bhd and Boustead Holdings Bhd, and said that the government could test the water with the sale of smaller stakes to see how the market reacts before touching the bigger investments.Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie said the investments that could potentially be disposed of depend on the government’s definition of “matured assets”.“Based on Khazanah’s new mandate, it seems to be referring to businesses that can already stand on their own feet, with decent price-to-book that no longer needs institutional funds as anchor investors.“The companies that come to mind in terms of monetisation could be CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, TM and other companies in the utility and aviation sectors,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/listing-unlisted-glcs-will-improve-operations-%E2%80%94-fund-managers,"2019-05-01 20:06:04"

Quarterly revenue fell 3.5% to RM3.09 billion from RM3.2 billion previously.For FY18 as a whole, the group’s net profit declined 83.5% to RM153.15 million, from RM929.75 million for FY17, with revenue slipping 2.2% to RM11.82 billion from RM12.09 billion.Another analyst said while the move to sell non-core assets was part of TM’s playbook to improve its balance sheet, it could also signal the group’s intention to be an “asset-light entity” as it shifts its focus to digitalisation.Asked if he expects an escalation in the number of asset sales in the near future, the analyst said he does not as TM has been consistent in its desire to unlock the value of its non-core assets as part of its strategy.“They (TM) have a lot of legacy assets such as exchanges, with some of these exchanges being converted into IT (information technology) exchanges. There is a need to relook at the entire portfolio of assets that they have,” he said.The analyst explained that the group has a lot of infrastructure that could be repurposed, with one example being the conversion of telephone switch exchanges into IT exchanges for the provision of the Internet.TM announced late last month that it would be selling its Annexe 1 and Annexe 2 buildings at its headquarters in Kuala Lumpur for between RM273.4 million and RM312 million, depending on whether the buildings are in a vacant state or with tenancy agreements upon purchase.TM acting group chief executive officer Imri Mokhtar has been reported as saying that the group is looking at transforming itself into a more agile organisation that can quickly take advantage of new opportunities.Imri said the group is looking at only selling such assets for what it deems as fetching a “good value”, with the proceeds from such disposals utilised by its core business activities and working capital requirements.Both analysts are of the belief that 2018 was a particularly bad year for TM and that the net impact of the government’s Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP) on high-speed broadband of the telco has yet to be fully realised, as a full year has to be given for a clearer view on its impact.They added that the group’s FY18 results were resultant of the group lowering its prices as per the MSAP and increased competition from others telcos, particularly with high-speed broadband.For the second analyst, TM has to deal with short-term challenges such as a reduction in its workforce as it transitions into a more digital company. TM has a 12-month target price of RM2.88, with three “buy” calls, 15 “hold” calls and nine “sell” calls on the stock.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tms-sale-noncore-assets-welcome-move-say-analysts,"2019-05-01 20:06:05"

Whatever assets they have, they want the assets to give the optimum profitability.""Any business would want to do that, it is something that should have been done in the first place,"" he said.At the end of the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, the group said it had borrowed RM8.57 billion, with 18% or RM1.54 billion denominated in US dollar.The analyst added the sale was something the group should be doing in light of 2018's diminished profit and revenue.TM saw a 78% decrease in net profit for its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (4QFY18) to RM69.66 million, from RM277.01 million previously.Quarterly revenue also decreased, in this instance by 3.5% to RM3.09 billion, from RM3.2 billion in 4QFY17.For the full financial year, the group saw its net profit decline by 83.5% to RM153.15 million from RM929.75 million the previous year, with revenue dipping 2.2% year-on-year to RM11.82 billion from RM12.09 billion.In a similar vein, another analyst who wished to remain anonymous said the sale of non-core assets, while part of the group's move to improve its balance sheet, was also part of a drive towards being ""an asset-light entity"", as the telco seeks to further digitalise.""From the point of view of telcos moving into digitalisation, the intention is to move towards being an asset-light entity.""So you free yourself from assets and non-core investments so that you can focus on selling your products and services through a digital landscape,"" he said.The analyst added he does not forecast any more such sales occurring in the near term, as the group has been continuously working on the sale of non-core assets as part of its strategy.""They (TM) have a lot of legacy assets such as exchanges, with some of these exchanges being converted into IT exchanges.""There is a need to relook at the entire portfolio of assets that they have,"" he said.According to a media report today, the telco has a land bank of RM2.9 billion as per its 2017 annual report, with the land and buildings being distributed across Malaysia, as well as a property in Hong Kong.TM acting group chief executive officer Imri Mokhtar was reported to have said the group over the past few years has been looking at unlocking the value of its buildings as it continues to optimise its network, adding that it will only sell if the group gets ""good value"" for the assets in question.Both analysts said the group's FY18 results were resultant of the group lowering its prices as per the Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP), as well as increased competition from other telcos, particularly in the realm of high-speed broadband.The duo added the jury is still out on the full impact of MSAP, and that only later this year will both investors and the telco industry be able to grasp the pricing policy's full impact.""They are no longer the sole player now (in high-speed broadband), there are more people coming into the game (the high-speed broadband market), things are getting more competitive, they are not a monopoly anymore,"" said the first analyst.Meanwhile, the second analyst said that in the short term the group will have to deal with challenges such as a reduction in its workforce as it moves forward with its digitalisation agenda.""They need to address a couple of structural issues that they have.

323,"March 18, 2019 17:00 pm +08",TM,"Who’s right about Khazanah’s 2018 (under)performance?","EVIDENTLY, billion-ringgit headline losses were too good an opportunity to gain political mileage to let slip, going by the heated social media exchanges between Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali and former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak last week.When it comes to reported numbers, Najib — who was chairman of Khazanah Nasional Bhd until May 31 last year — is not wrong in saying that the sovereign wealth fund’s RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 were the first it has reported in over a decade.Yet, part of the reason for last year’s underperformance was Khazanah’s portfolio of assets, which was concentrated in a handful of companies it had long invested in. The concentration risk was partly why Khazanah needed to rebalance its portfolio to deliver on its new mandate of growing Malaysia’s long-term wealth.A strategic review of its investments resulted in a RM7.3 billion impairment provision for 2018.“Roughly half” of the RM7.3 billion impairment was due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which Khazanah nationalised in 2014 after paying RM1.4 billion for the remaining 30% stake it did not own.Had that sizeable impairment for the loss-making national carrier been deemed necessary in 2017, Khazanah’s total impairment that year would have been nearer to RM5.95 billion — more than double the RM2.3 billion it booked that year. An impairment of that size would have wiped out the fund’s RM2.896 billion pre-tax profits for 2017 and resulted in two straight years of losses, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. Kitchen-sinking?Khazanah does not expect any large impairments to take place this year, even as Malaysia Airlines goes through another round of strategic review to improve its performance.“Khazanah should be able to return to profit [in 2019], given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books,” managing director Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said on March 5 when presenting the company’s annual review. He also provided more details on its dual-basket — strategic and commercial — investment fund structure, objectives and targets.The sovereign wealth fund will need at least five to seven years to rebalance its portfolio into one that can sustainably provide consistent supplementary income to the government, Shahril told The Edge in a recent interview. Apart from supporting the government’s developmental goals via its strategic investments, its commercial fund will be more diversified in terms of asset allocation, sector and geography.As it is, its portfolio concentration risk can also be seen from its so-called net worth adjusted (NWA) value where one-third of the RM25 billion or 21.6% year-on-year decline to RM91 billion as at end-2018 came from two companies — Axiata Group Bhd (-RM5 billion) and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (-RM3.5 billion).Other sizeable downward NWA adjustments were made for its holdings in Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-RM1.5 billion) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-RM200 million). The six made up RM14 billion or 56% of Khazanah’s NWA decline. Domestic factors, dealsWhile global markets underperformed last year on the back of geopolitical tension and pessimism over growth in emerging markets, Khazanah’s portfolio performance was further hampered by domestic developments, including regulatory changes, subdued earnings outlook and market volatility.To be sure, the headline RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 are sizeable.Still, the RM7.3 billion (non-cash) impairment does not affect Khazanah’s cash flow position and capacity to pay RM1.5 billion in dividend for 2018. The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends and booked RM1.4 billion divestment gains last year, down from RM3.1 billion in dividends and RM2.8 billion divestment gains in 2017.Khazanah paid RM30 million in dividend in 2005 when it reported a RM831 million pre-tax loss. It paid RM100 million in dividend in 2008 when it reported a RM223 million net loss in 2018. For 2019, the guidance is for “RM1 billion to RM1.5 billion” in dividend.It is understood that Khazanah’s sale of a 16% stake in IHH to Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM8.42 billion, which is targeted to be completed by end-March, is still awaiting foreign regulatory approval. According to Shahril, the proceeds will be used to rebalance its portfolio to generate greater returns for the country.A separate 26% stake in IHH is up for sale at the right price, as long as it does not destroy the value of the remaining holdings in Khazanah’s commercial basket. Other assets in the basket include its holdings in CIMB, Axiata and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Co, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.Meanwhile, assets in its strategic basket are Malaysia Airlines, Telekom Malaysia, Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia Airports and PLUS Malaysia Bhd. Developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd (TARH), Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd are also in this basket where economic benefits to the country also count as returns.It remains to be seen if UK-listed Merlin Entertainments plc, which makes money from operating Le­goland Malaysia on behalf of TARH, would buy a stake in the asset from Khazanah — just like how Mitsui had increased its stake in IHH by buying more shares from Kha­zanah. Talk of the potential sale of Legoland or an IPO of Khazanah’s theme parks had been circulating for some years.While Shahril said Khazanah was “not in talks with anyone and there are no offers on the table” when asked about the sale of Le­goland, he did not dismiss the possibility. “Everything has a value at the end of the day and if a great valuation comes in, we will look and see whether the capital that can be returned to our books can be better deployed in other areas,” he said, noting that Legoland is already profitable.Apart from behaving more like a portfolio manager to derive greater returns on its commercial assets, Khazanah is also targeting better cost-efficiency by cutting its cost-to-realisable asset value (RAV) ratio from 50 basis points in 2018 to 30 to 35 basis points in 2023. Part of this could come as it vacates premium office space at the Petronas Twin Towers in favour of transit-oriented Mercu UEM in KL Sentral. Khazanah, which has a long-term lease for 11,500 sq ft at The Shard in London, also has offices in Istanbul, Beijing, Mumbai and San Francisco.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example … we need people on the ground to ensure those assets are managed well and are creating value for Khazanah as a whole. Some of the other offices, for instance in London, may be less important because we will be adopting a more market-driven approach … if there is a cost benefit to us by running the international offices in a different way, we will make those decisions as we go along,” Shahril said.If Khazanah succeeds in becoming a significant revenue contributor to the government, there will be more money to improve the people’s well-being and less pressure to raise taxes. For the electorate, tangible benefits from sound public policy should ring truer than fleeting attention on social media.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/whos-right-about-khazanahs-2018-underperformance,"2019-05-01 20:06:07"
324,"March 18, 2019 07:00 am +08",TM,"Building trust is not just the CEO’s job","For businesses and corporates, trust is a powerful currency that is often attached to their management’s reputation, among other things.Hence the aftermath of the 14th general election (GE14) in May 2018, when Corporate Malaysia saw many abrupt changes at the helm of larger companies that, eventually, turned the spotlight on the affected businesses.Among the questions that arose were how should companies protect the trust they have amid unplanned leadership shifts, and how should they mitigate any impact on confidence such changes has had.The answer is to consider the long-term effect when it comes to trust, according to PwC Malaysia managing partner Sridharan Nair, or Sri as he is known.An organisation that has built up its reservoir of trust and embedded it as part of corporate values can stand the test of time regardless of leadership changes, Sri explains.“There is a saying that consistency is the true foundation of trust. So if you do not have that consistency in an organisation, then this raises doubts [among stakeholders].“So, a balance has to be struck — the person whose face is on the front is the leader, but it is the organisation which [provides support], so it is not just what the leader says but how the group behaves as well,” he adds.That said, the onus of building confidence — or renewing it, as the case may be — lies with a company’s management that is often seen as its face as well.And the leader needs the backing of the organisation to be successful in doing that, says Sri.“The tone at the top needs to be set, essentially, to say ‘we need to promote integrity at the highest levels all the way through the organisation’,” he tells The Edge.“However, it is not just about rolling out a plan or initiative; it is how you see it through, from the actions to the enforcement of it [throughout the organisation],” he adds.The growing spotlight on the role of leadership in trust is accorded consideration in the PwC Malaysia Building Trust Awards, which returns this year for the third time since its inaugural edition back in 2015.The biennial awards recognise companies that are making significant moves in building integrity through their communications and interactions with stakeholders.To recap, no submissions or nominations are accepted for the awards. Instead, only the top 50 Malaysian public-listed companies (PLCs) on Bursa Malaysia by market capitalisation are considered.The annual reports of these 50 companies are then benchmarked against the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework (refer to Methodology). This would be based on the latest available annual reports as of June 2018. Following this, a total of 20 companies are then shortlisted. For this year, the 20 finalists listed in alphabetical order are: AirAsia Group Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, BIMB Holdings Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Digi.com Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, KLCCP Stapled Group, Malayan Banking Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Maxis Bhd, MISC Bhd, Petronas, RHB Bank Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Sunway Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.PwC Malaysia assurance and people partner Pauline Ho says on top of the existing assessment methodology, an additional survey was introduced this year as part of three dimensions of measuring trust perception in collaboration with The Iclif Leadership and Governance Centre (Iclif).According to Ho, the extra survey looks at trust in leadership as the first dimension. The review is designed for an organisation’s employees to answer questions surrounding leadership and their confidence in their company’s leadership team.For the second dimension, PwC conducts an independent survey via a third party to comb through online sources of data for conversations about trust on the 20 shortlisted organisations in order to build a trust profile for each.“The third dimension is a public poll, which is open to the public until March 31, 2019, where we get anyone who is not working within the organisation to comment on whether these [companies] are building trust,” says Ho.“[Through this] we have these different perspectives so that we not only listen to what the companies say about themselves, but also what employees think about their leadership and what the third parties are saying, as well as the public opinion,” Ho concludes.The findings will then be deliberated on by an independent panel of four judges who will select the winners.Rounding up the 2019 Building Trust Awards panel of judges are Sir David Tweedie who is the chairman of the board of trustees of the International Valuation Standards Council and past chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board; Tan Sri Dr Jemilah Mahmood who is under secretary general, partnerships at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; Malek Ali, who is the founder of BFM 89.9; and Nadiah Wan, the group CEO of TMC Life Sciences Bhd and CEO of the Thomson Hospital, Kota Damansara.The results will be revealed at an awards ceremony to be held in Kuala Lumpur, which is scheduled to take place in the second half of the year.This year, PwC also engaged the growing start-up community to understand their perspective on trust. However, start-up organisations are not part of the awards, which are currently meant for PLCs only.From the engagement, it is clear that large corporates can draw important lessons from start-ups on how to protect trust, which is vital to any start-up’s long-term survival, says Sri.“If they (start-ups) cannot get that (trust management) right, they believe that they are not going to be able to survive as a business. And I think that is probably a lesson for larger corporates where as you get bigger, you may have other priorities such as expansion or other engagement with stakeholders and shareholders as opposed to which segment actually makes your business work, which is the consumers who buy your products or services,” says Sri.“So we have seen the larger corporates refocusing on consumers and customers over the years. Their focus is on consumers and making sure that they get their consumers to believe in their idea and to address and to be very responsive to those consumers’ comments as well,” he adds.Interestingly, many start-ups feel that it is easier to boost trust as a big business, Sri reflects. On the other hand, start-ups also believe they can build up their trust reservoir through technology much faster, he adds.“They also believe that in the start-up phase, they can connect with the consumers quicker and in a more authentic manner than much more established businesses.“And, for established businesses, when you go into something that is new, it is more difficult to build trust because you are seen as this sort of business and doing this sort of thing, [but] trying to venture into something new.”In any case, the growing trust awareness in the business ecosystem in Malaysia is positive given that the private sector is a key driver of the economy, Sri says.“At the end of the day, it is about having businesses, corporates and start-ups, having the dialogue and discussion about the importance of trust. Businesses have a big role to play, and if we are able to raise the bar on how important trust is, then we are heading in the right direction.”To participate in the online poll, please visit http://bit.ly/pwctrustpoll 2019. CEOs weigh in on trust...As a leader, how do you inspire a culture of trust in Maybank?
Trust is ultimately about aligning personal and collective interests of a group to a pre-agreed destination — relying on each individual to do his part, so that the outcome is greater than the sum of the parts. The challenge is to ensure agreement among members that group interests should always take precedence over personal ones. It is ultimately a balancing act that needs to be monitored constantly.— Datuk Abdul Farid Alias,
Group President & CEO,
Malayan Banking Bhd (winning company of the 2015 awards) How did Sime Darby Group sustain employee trust amidst the leadership changes following the demerger?
With the new leadership team in place, we set out to meet with groups of employees across our operations. These sessions were essentially open platforms for employees to air any concerns or questions they had, and for them to share their thoughts and ideas for the new organisation. They also provided us the opportunity to communicate our new vision, strategy and targets, and to project the new culture for Sime Darby Bhd.  — Datuk Jeffri Salim Davidson,
Group CEO,
Sime Darby Bhd (winning company of the 2017 awards) How can leaders articulate trust in a simple yet meaningful manner to their employees?  
For leaders to express trust to their employees, there must be commitment to a purpose that entails creating a better future for their people. Not only is it important for employees to know that their leader is committed to a worthy purpose; the leader must pursue that purpose based on the right set of values.  Deeply held values play a huge role in earning trust. Earning the trust of one’s employees is not just a soft, nice-to-have asset; it is the hard currency that makes a difference between success and failure.How can leaders build trust for their organisation’s long-lasting success?
Leaders build trust for their organisations through their actions – by setting direction that creates meaningful value for their stakeholders and enables empowered decision-making. In addition, leaders focus on designing the structures, deploying the right resources and supporting systems to execute the strategy. Underpinning all this, is the accountability for creating a culture of long-lasting excellence based on the right values and leading by example.—  Rajeev Peshawaria,

The 29.8% stake in TH Heavy Engineering Bhd is an example. Urusharta Jamaah paid RM380.3 million for the block of 334.16 million shares, compared with its market value of RM10.02 million. The lowest premium is on the block of 65.51 million shares in MISC Bhd, which was transferred at RM486.53 million, or a 10.85% premium over its value of RM438.93 million at end-2018, according to the list attached to the written reply from Prime Minister Departments (PMD) to Dewan Rakyat yesterday.PMD highlighted in the reply that if prudent accounting standard was practiced by LTH in the past, the pilgrim fund would have been able to continue holding onto these assets. Its reply said the assets acquired by Urusharta can be categorised into three types: properties, a non-listed company, and public listed securities.Urusharta is a special purpose vehicle set up by the government to revive LTH’s financial health caused by the large deficit between its assets and liabilities. It is acquiring the pilgrims fund’s underperforming properties and equities in exchange for RM10 billion in non-tradable sukuk, and RM9.9 billion in Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares as part of its restructuring plan.By exchanging its RM10 billion non-performing assets for RM19.9 billion worth of sukuk and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares, it will help remove the pilgrim fund’s massive impairments on its assets.  The restructuring plan will ensure the fund will be able to make hibah distributions according to the Tabung Haji Act 1995, said PMD.PMD said overall, the assets transferred from LTH to the SPV comprises 29 properties, one company that is not public listed, and equity stake or derivatives in 106 public listed companies.“If a prudent impairment rate has been practiced previously by the old management, not at 90% level, and the provision of impairment is made on the profit and loss statements in the past years, of course, LTH will be capable of continuing to hold all of these shares,” it added.PMD pointed out that over the past few years, all of these equity losses were parked under ‘other reserves’ in LTH’s financial statements in order to continue showing high profit, and to ensure there were hibah payments every year. Consequently, this has resulted in the widening gap between its assets and liabilities.PMD said based on LTH’s audited financial statements for 2017, ‘other reserves’ shows a negative value of RM4.6 billion.Therefore, PMD said the government’s intention is to restore LTH’s financial position by taking over these losses to close the widening deficit.PMD said Urusharta Jamaah’s role now is to implement rehabilitation for these assets through warehousing strategy and restructuring, while continuing the operations of the transferred assets to maximise their recovery value.On top of that, PMD said Urusharta Jamaah will redeem all the financial instruments it issued and subscribed by LTH.The issue of LTH's asset transfers was raised by Ahmad Amzad Mohamed @ Hashim (PAS-Kuala Terengganu) yesterday, who had asked the Prime Minister to state the value of each asset (equity and property) that has been transferred to Syarikat Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd by LTH.PropertiesNon-listed CompanyDomestic equity securities",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/pms-dept-if-tabung-haji-practices-prudent-accounting-govt-wont-need-take-over-assets-premium,"2019-05-01 20:06:08"

Their resignations will take effect on April 1.“In ensuring our commitment towards customers is continuously fulfilled in line with our next phase of transformation into ‘New TM’ — a customer-centric organisation — via the Performance Improvement Programme 2019-2021, their positions will be covered by the senior officials who are currently their direct reports,” said TM.With the departure of Ahmad Azhar as the CDO, the Group Digital Centre (GDC) will be overseen by general manager Hizam Ghazali, who has been part of the GDC since 2018.“Hizam will continue the effort of realising TM’s strategic thrust of empowering digital,” said TM.In the interim, Asmawati Yusof, chief network and IT architecture with 33 years of experience in the technical field, will assume the role of the CTIO, a position vacated by Mohd Rais.Meanwhile, the role of CISO will be covered by the head, Mohd Nazri Zawawi. With 21 years of service in TM, Mohd Nazri has been attached to group information security since its formation in 2017.Notably, TM’s management has undergone several changes in the past nine months, including the resignation of managing director and group chief executive officer (CEO) Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly in June last year.Its then executive director and deputy group CEO Datuk Bazlan Osman, who was appointed as acting group CEO following Mohammed Shazalli’s departure, resigned from the top post in November last year.For the interim, TM has appointed chief operating officer Imri Mokhtar to become acting group CEO.In December last year, TM appointed Rosli Man as a non-independent and non-executive chairman of the group effective immediately, replacing Tan Sri Dr Sulaiman Mahbob, who resigned on Nov 30 last year.A quick check on TM’s website shows that Mohd Rais, 53, was appointed CTIO effective Feb 18 last year, and CISO since Jan 1, 2017.Formerly the deputy CTIO in 2017 and appointed vice-president of network architecture and technology in 2010, he was instrumental in various transformation projects in TM including the national high-speed broadband (HSBB) project launched in March 2010.As for Ahmad Azhar, a 54-year-old who joined TM as group chief information officer in August 2004, he has been involved in strategic planning and change management, business and operations support systems, enterprise resource management, revenue and customer relationship management.He was later appointed TM programme director for the HSBB project in 2008, and contributed to the successful launch of UniFi.Ahmad Azhar assumed various positions in TM; including chief strategy officer and chief customer advocate, before he was appointed CDO in October 2016 to head TM’s digital transformation initiatives throughout the group.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/more-clevel-departures-tm,"2019-05-01 20:06:08"

You can’t compare Telekom to Maxis, it’s like comparing apples with oranges.

(March 12, RM3.25)
Downgrade to neutral with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM3.60: Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) saw a challenging 2018 with headline net profit falling over 80% — core earnings were down 27% — following the Mandatory Standard Access Pricing (MSAP) implementation resulting in a lower revenue and margin, as well as higher impairments. For 2019, we see an easing of regulatory pressures, though the dust may not have settled as we had yet to witness the full impact of the cut in wholesale prices as customers could still switch to cheaper packages.We expect a more significant impact on the retail segment with Unifi’s higher average revenue per user (Arpu) falling 15%, while there may still be further provisions in the wholesale segment, though the amount could be smaller than that in financial year 2018 (FY18). Meanwhile, we think an accelerated depreciation or impairment on outdated fixed network assets may persist in FY19 forecast. Since our upgrade on Nov 27, 2018, TM’s share price has risen 38%. Given a less compelling upside to our discounted cash flow (DCF)-based TP of RM3.60, we cut our rating from “trading buy” to “neutral”.In FY18, TM recognised a provision of RM169.2 million arising from an estimated impact of the MSAP. We believe there could still be a further provision but the amount may be smaller than what was recognised in FY18, which should have taken into account the key services governed under the MSAP. As TM is still finalising rates with access seekers, we think there could still be some space for a further provision on perhaps the unregulated services, though the amount could be lower. Meanwhile, the retail segment should also be affected by a more substantial decline in Arpu. We assumed a 15% decline in Unifi’s Arpu to RM163 in FY19F, compared with only a 4% drop in FY18. Overall, we estimate FY19F revenue to fall 7% mainly due to a lower data and Internet revenue.In FY18, TM also recognised an impairment of RM982.5 million on its fixed and wireless network assets, mainly due to technology obsolescence. Based on our estimate, the book value of TM’s telecommunication networks as at Dec 31, 2018 could be about RM10 billion. We worked out that accumulated impairment on network assets provided thus far amounted to RM1.2 billion, recognised in FY16 to FY18. We’re not ruling out the possibility of a further impairment or an accelerated depreciation to be made in future, particularly for its outdated copper cable network where its fair value could have fallen below its recorded cost due to rapid technological changes.TM’s core earnings will not be affected by the provision and impairment as these items are excluded when evaluating the business’ underlying performance. We are maintaining our core earnings forecasts. However, we believe there could be some downside risks in terms of headline profit due to a potential impairment on its obsolete fixed network assets, which could lead to a lower dividend per share as its 40% to 60% payout guidance is based on reported figures. — PublicInvest Research, March 12",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/regulatory-pressure-easing-likely-tm,"2019-05-01 20:06:09"

Only 391 companies saw an improvement in their earnings per share (EPS).A look at the earnings results last week by The Edge found that 257 companies had recorded a decline in EPS, 145 slipped into the red and 74 saw their losses widen compared with the previous year. Only 224 companies recorded EPS growth with 113 turning profitable and 54 narrowing their losses.According to Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau, 4Q earnings were largely in line with expectations, as seen by some of the earnings downgrades towards the end of last year.“If you look at the market, most analysts cut their earnings projections last year. This was reflected by the decline in the stock market. As we have seen, the lacklustre third-quarter earnings have continued into the fourth quarter, albeit with a bit of improvement,” Lau says.Indeed, 4Q earnings were slightly better than 3Q’s, with 249 companies recording EPS growth versus 228 that contracted.Bloomberg data shows that the construction sector was among those affected as 27 players saw a decline in earnings versus 11 that recorded growth.Apart from construction, property, food packaging and plantations were among the top losers. The logistics sector also saw an increase in underperformers as competition in the space intensified.The banking sector had a relatively good 2018, but results were mixed in the last quarter, a notable decline was seen in Public Bank Bhd’s EPS on a year-on-year basis.The automotive and oil and gas sectors look fairly interesting as there are selective opportunities for investors, given that some companies turned around in 4Q.MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman says the results have generally met expectations — banks, healthcare and construction companies under its coverage look good.Other sectors turned in mixed results, a notable loser being plantations, owing to lower crude palm oil (CPO) prices in 4Q2018.“Looking at the winners, we reckon it is better to look at company specifics. For example, those related to commodity prices. While the price of oil was high for the first half of 4Q (until around mid-November), most oil and gas counters saw weak earnings. Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd did well, aided by a higher plant utilisation rate and selling prices, while Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd’s increased work orders for its maintenance services resulted in strong top and bottom-line growth,” Redza says.Even though the environment in the O&G space remains challenging, 11 companies managed to turn profitable during the quarter, including Dayang Enterprise and Velesto Energy Bhd.Redza observes that although the higher oil price did not create a clear winner in the O&G industry, it did impact the aviation sector. AirAsia Group Bhd and AirAsia X Bhd flew into the red during 4Q, while Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd’s (MAHB) earnings (excluding one-off gains) were also below expectations.He adds that other winners include IHH Healthcare Bhd and UEM Edgenta Bhd.Another winner was the insurance industry. Tune Protect Group Bhd and Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd did well, driven by the travel reinsurance segment and higher net earned contributions respectively.“There was good earnings recovery for some of the telcos but Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd saw a drastic deterioration in earnings,” Redza says.Moving forward, he believes there will be some upside, especially on the commodity front, as higher CPO prices and recovering palm oil exports will boost plantation companies.“Construction players will also see better outcomes as uncertainties over project awards become a thing of the past, and we have seen a slew of contracts won by companies such as Sunway Construction Group Bhd, Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, KKB Engineering Bhd and Hock Seng Lee Bhd, which have been announced in recent months.“It looks like our bullish view on infrastructure development in Sarawak has come to fruition,” Redza says, adding that upward revisions to earnings expectations are on the cards. However, they are unlikely to be across the board amid uncertainties over geopolitical issues.Lau agrees with Redza. He says that even some companies that were perceived to be linked to the previous government managed to record strong earnings.MyEG Services Bhd was one such, posting strong quarterly earnings of RM58.1 million, or 1.7 sen per share, translating into a net margin of about 50%.Most companies warn that the outlook for 2019 remains cautious amid uncertainties over geopolitical tensions in the form of the US-China trade war, Brexit and regional elections.“The key risks remain those on the external front, such as the US-China trade negotiations,” Lau opines.But another fund manager with a local asset management firm believes that local political developments will play an even more critical role as corporates are looking at Pakatan Harapan’s policies and direction before making any investment decisions.“Most of the guidance for 2019 has been for cautious optimism. It is because many are waiting to see if there is any impact from some of the changes made by the new government.“We are also seeing that the government is talking about potentially continuing with some of the infrastructure projects that are under heavy scrutiny, such as the ECRL (East Coast Rail Link) project,” he says. The FBM KLCI’s EPS fell 10% y-o-y in 2018The FBM KLCI component stocks saw 2018 EPS fall by about a tenth compared with a year ago, with Axiata and Genting Malaysia Bhd being the top losers. Both companies slipped into a net loss. The gaming counter slid into its first annual loss since 2000, of 3.5 sen per share, while the telco saw its first full-year loss of 55.6 sen per share since listing in 2008.Twelve of the 30 component stocks also posted weaker performances last year compared with 2017. They include plantation players Sime Darby Plantations Bhd and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK).Petronas Dagangan Bhd’s EPS also dropped about 45% to 85.5 sen last year, from FY2017.MAHB, on the other hand, was the top performer last year with a tripling of its EPS, mainly due to an unrealised gain on the fair value of its investment in GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd.The airport operator was followed by IOI Corp Bhd and Top Glove Bhd.The banking sector was also one of last year’s bright spots, based on the growth recorded by CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, AMMB Holdings Bhd and Malayan Banking Bhd.An analyst at a local investment bank believes investors had priced in weaker 4Q earnings. Their instinct proved spot-on as the equity benchmark index shrank 5.9% last year. Year to date, it has gained 1% to close at 1,707.73 points last Thursday.While it is still early days, investors could be gearing up to put last year’s underperformance behind them in the belief that a gradual recovery could be in place. There are some signs pointing in that direction. The Bursa Malaysia Construction Index plunged 50% last year, but is one of the top performers year to date, with a gain of 15.7%.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-4q-earnings-weaker-year-year-improvement-over-3q,"2019-05-01 20:06:12"

Maintain neutral on the respective sectors: The telco sector’s fourth quarter of 2018 (4Q18) results were somewhat mixed as normalised earnings of Digi.Com Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd came in within expectations while Telekom Malaysia (TM) Bhd did not suffer profit erosion as bad as we had expected from the mandatory standard access pricing (MSAP) regime and repriced Unifi options. 
Time dotcom Bhd’s (TIME) results were stronger than expectations with its second half (2H) earnings coming in above the management’s guidance due to continued fixed broadband growth in the wholesale, retail and enterprise markets. Maxis underperformed due to additional costs for productivity enhancement and marketing for its fiberised solutions targeting the enterprise segment.As Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo has recently indicated that high-speed broadband prices will not be cut this year, TM’s earnings prospects have stabilised for now with around 90% of its Streamyx and Unifi existing customers having been upgraded to faster speed packages while experiencing minimal downtrading activities together with manageable revenue declines in its financial year 2018 (FY18). This was supported by TIME’s experience wherein customers took up faster speed packages versus (vs) more affordable options.Cellular operators’ (celco) 4Q18 net profit fell 30% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM790 million largely even though revenue improved, up 1% q-o-q and 5% y-o-y respectively, from higher average revenue per user (Arpu) and postpaid subscribers for Celcom and Digi. The lower bottom line stemmed from a six percentage points q-o-q decline in net profit margin to 13% from Maxis’ additional marketing/operational costs and Celcom’s higher depreciation and tax charges.Total subscribers continued to contract amid tight competition and ongoing SIM consolidation, declining q-o-q by 344,000 subscribers and 723,000 subscribers y-o-y to 31 million subscribers. A major portion of the y-o-y decline stemmed from Celcom, which lost 470,000 subscribers while Maxis shed 167,000 subscribers and Digi 86,000 subscribers. These contractions stemmed purely from the prepaid segment, which shrank by 606,000 subscribers q-o-q and 1.5 million subscribers y-o-y to 22.5 million subscribers.While the prepaid subscriber base continued to dwindle, the higher value postpaid segment grew by 262,000 subscribers (3%) q-o-q and 790,000 subscribers (10%) y-o-y respectively. This underpinned the celco service revenue momentum, which increased by 1% q-o-q and 5% y-o-y, to RM6 billion as blended Arpu rose by RM1 per month to RM49 per month.Maxis remained the revenue leader despite Digi’s larger subscriber base. Digi continued to command the largest subscriber market share at 37% vs Maxis’ 34% while Celcom remained a distant third at 29%. Digi’s pole position since 1Q16 stemmed largely from its strength in the prepaid segment, underpinned by the migrant population. However, Maxis was stronger in the postpaid segment with an Arpu and subscriber base which were 29% and 14% respectively higher than Digi’s. This placed Maxis in the leading position with a 2018 revenue market share of 40% vs 32% for Celcom and 28% for Digi.Maxis, which is already an established player in the fiberised solutions via the leasing of TM’s high-speed broadband network, is aiming to penetrate more aggressively the business and enterprise markets by offering converged offerings. Celcom has started offering home fibre solutions in Sabah while Digi is testing the waters at the Jasin pilot project in Melaka.Since the middle of 2018, no celco has launched a comparable package to counter U Mobile Sdn Bhd’s prepaid GX30 which offers unlimited data with speeds up to 3Mbps for just RM30 per month. Recall that U Mobile also launched postpaid GX50 which provides unlimited voice and data with speeds up to 5Mbps for RM50 per month.Postpaid plans for Digi remained at RM58 per month for 10GB data, Celcom offers RM80 per month for 20GB data and Maxis RM98 per month for 40GB. However, Digi also offers unlimited voice and data plans via online registration at a higher priced RM100 per month for speeds of up to 10Mbps, similar to Unifi mobile’s unlimited voice and data plan at RM99 per month.Even though there appeared to be a half-year ceasefire in the postpaid wars, near- to medium-term revenue growth outlook remains weak against the backdrop of persistent pressure to gain market share. As U Mobile and Unifi mobile wrestle for new customers on the unlimited mobile data arena, prospects for incremental service revenue accretions are unexciting at this stage, underscored by the sector’s tepid forward momentum over the past years.Maintain “neutral” call given the continued intense competition in both the mobile and fixed broadband markets. We have “hold” calls on Axiata, TM and Digi while Maxis is “underweight” due to its premium valuations despite its financial year 2019 forecast (FY19F) guidance for an Ebitda decline amid additional capital expenditure for fiberised solutions, digitalisation and productivity capabilities. — AmInvestment Bank, March 6",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mixed-results-telco-sector-amid-moderating-regulatory-pressures,"2019-05-01 20:06:13"
334,"March 06, 2019 08:31 am +08",TM,"Khazanah posts first pre-tax loss since 2005","KUALA LUMPUR: Khazanah Nasional Bhd posted its first pre-tax loss in 13 years in 2018, amid significant impairment provisions made during the year — a big chunk of which was due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB) — but hopes to return to profitability in 2019.The sovereign wealth fund reported a pre-tax loss of RM6.3 billion for 2018, compared to its pre-tax profit of RM2.9 billion in the preceding year, after recording impairments totalling RM7.3 billion — more than triple the RM2.3 billion seen in 2017.The last time it fell into the red was in 2005, when the fund reported a pre-tax loss of RM831 million.Khazanah managing director (MD) Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said the sizeable impairment reflected the drop in market value of the share prices of listed stocks the fund holds, as well as the decline in the fair carrying value of some of its unlisted assets.“Our performance in 2018 was impacted by several key global and domestic developments in both the economic and social spheres. At the same time, the government initiated a reset of Khazanah, which involved significant changes including a refreshed mandate,” he said at the Khazanah annual review yesterday.The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends from its investments in 2018, down 9.7% from the RM3.1 billion it recorded in the previous year, while divestment gains halved to RM1.4 billion for the year from RM2.8 billion, reflecting the challenging market conditions during the year.“Looking ahead into 2019, Khazanah should be able to return to profit, given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books. We don’t expect any more large impairments that we have to go through again in 2018.“The provisions are primarily due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which accounted for roughly half of the total impairments for 2018,” he said.Its portfolio’s realisable asset value (RAV) — or the market value of all equities, securities and cash held — fell to RM136 billion in 2018 from RM157 billion a year ago. In terms of net worth adjusted — which is RAV less total liabilities and adjusted to measure value created — that fell 21.6% to RM91 billion from RM116 billion, weighed by subdued earnings outlook, market volatility and regulatory changes. Challenging conditions in the airline industryShahril said the airline industry is challenging, as he pointed to persistent overcapacity and how airlines in the country, such as the region’s leading low-cost airline AirAsia Bhd, are also struggling.While Malaysia Airlines was a drag on Khazanah’s financials for 2018, he justified the fund’s investment in the airline by saying that it provides other economic benefits to the country beyond the fund’s bottom line. As an example, he cited the connectivity it provides that brings business and leisure travellers into Malaysia, which indirectly contributes to the economy.However, he said that does not discount the fact that the national airline should be as operationally efficient as possible.“Quite clearly, the strategy put in place for Malaysia Airlines has not met its objectives. That is a fact we have to acknowledge. The question now is whether it makes sense to continue with the same strategy or do we need to rethink how the airline operates given the challenging environment?“We are waiting for Malaysia Airlines to complete its review and we will be looking at understanding what that startegy requires,” he said. Drop in TM’s market valueAnother factor that drove Khazanah into the red was Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), which saw a substantial fall in market value following the 83% drop in the group’s net profit for 2018, which Shahril attributed to regulatory changes.TM registered a 56.9% decline in total returns, the biggest decliner in Khazanah’s portfolio, followed by Axiata Group Bhd (-26.9%), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-9.3%), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-7.9%), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-7.6%) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-3.3%).Shahril said the market has priced in the fact that TM will take some time to improve its cost base, following the government’s move to bring down consumer pricing as quickly as possible.As the telecommunications company shifts its pricing to reflect the new regulatory environment, revenue will be affected, he said, but added that profitability will return given time. Portfolio rebalancing to spread risk concentrationMeanwhile, Shahril said the fund will remain focused on executing its portfolio rebalancing strategy and strengthening its financial position.He stressed that Khazanah is looking at long-term returns and that it is natural for there to be fluctuations in the market over long periods of time, especially since the fund’s portfolio is very much equity-based. “The key thing to focus on is the fact that we are restructuring the portfolio and are geared towards long-term returns,” Shahril said.The portfolio rebalancing, he said, will look at taking out some of the inherent risks in its portfolio, such as the concentration of risk it is facing given that a big chunk of its investments in Malaysia are tied up in just a few companies. So, over time, Khazanah will have a more balanced portfolio spread over more sectors and geographies to mitigate the concentration of risk, and benefit from a more diversified portfolio.Khazanah is also splitting its portfolio into two — commercial and strategic. The commercial portion targets returns equivalent to inflation plus 3% on a five-year rolling basis. It will comprise public assets such as CIMB, Axiata, IHH and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Company Sdn Bhd, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.The strategic portion is a developmental fund targeting returns equivalent to the 10-year Malaysian Government Securities yield on a five-year rolling basis. It includes strategic assets such as TM, TNB, MAB and PLUS Malaysia Bhd and developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia.Meanwhile, as part of the review of the fund’s operational costs, Khazanah is looking at the operations of its international offices and may take steps to improve their operations.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example. We have a lot of investments in the country and a lot of these are private equity investments, so we need people on the ground to ensure those assets are managed well and are creating value for Khazanah as a whole.“Some of the other offices, for instance in London, may be less important because we will be adopting a more market-driven approach. So, we can do more of the operations out of other offices. As we review our costs and business operations, if there is a cost benefit to us by running the international offices in a different way, we will make those decisions as we go along,” he said. Not in talks with any party for Legoland saleMeanwhile, when asked if Khazanah had received offers for Legoland Malaysia Resort — following a news report that the fund is looking to sell the theme park — Shahril said Khazanah is not in talks with any party, though the the fund is reviewing all its assets.“Legoland is not only Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) positive — it’s returning a positive profit as well. The time will come when we need to think about reinvesting the capital.“Everything has a value at the end of the day and if a great valuation comes in, we will look and see whether the capital that can be returned to our books can be better deployed in other areas,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/khazanah-posts-first-pretax-loss-2005,"2019-05-01 20:06:14"

""By being much more portfolio-based, you will have basically a lot more transactions happening as well.""Reuters reported last month, citing sources, that Khazanah's new strategy was aimed at delivering more cash to the government by pruning stakes in non-strategic assets.Khazanah will split investments in over 100 firms spanning more than 20 countries into two categories, Reuters reported.On Tuesday, Khazanah said the realisable asset value of its portfolio fell to RM136 billion (US$33.4 billion) in 2018 from RM157 billion a year prior.Its investments in companies including 27%-owned CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and 37%-owned Axiata Group Bhd as well as in China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd would become part of its commercial fund.Khazanah's stakes in CIMB, Axiata and IHH Healthcare Bhd are together worth US$12.2 billion, Reuters calculations showed based on Monday closing share prices.In November, Khazanah agreed to sell a 16% stake in IHH for about US$2 billion, a transaction it expects to complete by March-end.The commercial fund, which is aimed at growing financial assets and diversifying national revenue sources, will target a return equivalent to Malaysia's Consumer Price Index plus 3% on a five-year rolling basis, Khazanah said.A big chunk of Khazanah's assets is in only a few companies, which would have to be restructured gradually to enable a more balanced portfolio spread over sectors and geographies, Shahril said. The government also needed Khazanah as an alternative source of revenue to supplement its national budget, he said.Firms such as state utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd will be part of Khazanah's strategic fund.For the first time in a decade, Khazanah said it swung to a loss before tax of RM6.27 billion in 2018 from a profit before tax of RM2.89 billion in 2017, hit by reduced divestment, higher impairments and a lower dividend income.Shahril said Khazanah expected to return to profit this year. The fund announced a dividend of RM1.5 billion to the government for 2018.Shahril also said the government needed to take a call on its investment in struggling Malaysia Airlines.""The question really to be asked essentially is for every dollar invested in Malaysia Airlines, is it generating other economic benefits to the country? The government then needs to decide for itself what is the right level of investment or support for the airline at this point in time,"" Shahril said.(US$1 = RM4.0750)",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/khazanah-restructures-fund-two-groups-posts-weak-2018-results,"2019-05-01 20:06:15"

According to the company’s new managing director, Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan, its strategic fund only contains Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airlines Bhd and the Iskandar Malaysia economic zone in Johor.Its commercial fund holds more companies and includes CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, UEM Edgenta Bhd and UEM Sunrise Bhd.In his first interview with The Edge as managing director of Khazanah last week, Shahril made it clear that the company’s new approach to its commercial fund will be fully portfolio-based, but noted that it will take time to restructure its portfolio.A number of solid companies stand out.Bloomberg data shows that TIME is one of the outperformers in Khazanah’s portfolio as the telecommunications company has provided a total return of 913% over the last 10 years, translating into a compound annual gain of 26% over that period. That is impressive by most standards.Over the same period, UEM Edgenta, CIMB Group and Axiata also saw a strong run-up in their share prices, giving total returns of 658%, 149% and 142% respectively.Asia’s largest hospital operator, IHH Healthcare, is another outperformer with a total return of 79% since its listing in 2012, while UEM Sunrise yielded 49% over a 10-year period.An exception is dominant pay-television operator Astro Malaysia, whose share price has declined 22% since relisting on Bursa Malaysia in 2012, two years after it was taken private by tycoon T Ananda Krishnan.With such a portfolio, it will be interesting to see if Khazanah will dispose of its stars to capitalise on their profits, or cut its losses on some of the underperformers.Investors are keeping a close watch in the light of Khazanah’s disposal of a 16% stake in IHH Healthcare to Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM8.42 billion.Also of interest is the investment space occupied by Axiata, TIME and TM.“It will be interesting to see what happens next with Khazanah’s investment in Axiata and TIME. If the sovereign wealth fund is looking to manage its fund in a portfolio approach, it will have to diversify away from the telecoms industry. They are competing on the same front, along with TM. But if you look at Khazanah’s stakes in Axiata and TIME, it will also be hard for any disposal to be done due to liquidity constraints.“Of course, one can always argue that Axiata has a regional presence while TIME has a strong track record,” a fund manager with a local asset management company tells The Edge.Indeed, Khazanah’s share of value in the Malaysian telecoms sector amounts to some RM17 billion — more than a tenth of the sovereign wealth fund’s total realisable asset value of RM157.2 billion (as at Dec 31, 2017).Some question whether exposure in a sector known to be saturated both in terms of subscribers and competition will help the fund meet its long-term asset growth target.Analysts covering both TIME and Axiata, nonetheless, remain optimistic, based on their recommendations and target prices.For TIME, six out of seven analysts have a “buy” call, while the remaining one has a “hold”, with the 12-month average target price of RM9.47, indicating an upside potential of 15.1%.As for Axiata, 19 analysts have a “buy” and 10 have a “hold”, with the 12-month average target price of RM4.50, indicating a return potential of 5.1%.Bloomberg data estimates that Khazanah paid an average cost per share for TIME of RM1.67 and for Axiata of RM2.38, indicating a healthy profit gain should the fund decide to take profit. The average cost per share uses Khazanah’s historical holdings during its entire holding period and the volume weighted average price of the security during each period.Apart from the telcos, its investment in CIMB Group has also been profitable as Bloom­berg data shows that Khazanah’s average cost per share was RM3.40, indicating a return of about 71% in the event of a disposal.Its 92.5%-owned Indonesian banking arm, PT Bank CIMB Niaga Tbk, also appears to be performing more solidly, posting a 16.95% growth in net profit to IDR3.48 trillion (RM1.01 billion) for the year ended Dec 31 last year, on the back of an improvement in non-interest income and credit charges.Currently, there are 11 “buy” and an equal number of “hold” calls on CIMB Group with an average target price of RM6.39, indicating an upside potential of 10.2%.Ahmad Ramzani Ramli, an analyst at Kenanga, is one of those who have down­graded the stock to a “hold” because of demanding valuations amid challenging loan growth, an uptick in credit charges as well as downside pressure on net interest margin.UEM Edgenta — held through Khazanah’s wholly-owned subsidiary, UEM Group Bhd — has also been profitable for the fund, posting a gain of about 14% since 2014.The country’s largest integrated facilities management (IFM) provider, the company covers consultancy, services and solutions for the healthcare, infrastructure and real estate segments.A research house covering UEM Edgenta believes the compound annual growth rate of about 9% in the IFM market is positive for the company. In the past year, UEM Edgenta has yielded a total return of about 20% and all three of the analysts covering the stock have maintained their “buy” call with an average target price of RM3.25, indicating a return potential of 17.3%.The winners aside, Shahril has acknow­ledged the possibility of cutting losers. Bloom­berg data estimates the average cost per share of its investment in UEM Sunrise at RM1.22, indicating a potential loss of about 31%. It is worth noting that the group has been on a downward trend with a decline of about 65% in the last five years, although to be fair, nearly all property players are likely to be in the same boat given the dismal state of the property market.As for Astro Malaysia, investors have shied away from the stock as digital pirated copies, streaming as well as Android TV boxes with pre-loaded software give consumers access to content either for free or for a small sum — usually through illegal channels — taking away some of the pay-TV operator’s previous dominance.The emergence of giant media services player Netflix — another significant threat — along with smaller players such as iflix and dimsum.my, has noticeably raised the competition for eyeballs.Khazanah’s investment in Astro Malaysia — held via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pantai Cahaya Bulan Ventures Sdn Bhd — could have shrunk by about a third, based on Bloomberg estimates.It is interesting to note that Khazanah was Ananda’s partner in the 2010 privatisation of Astro Malaysia. Both parties had offered RM4.30 per share for the remaining 27.09% not owned by their special purpose vehicle, Astro Holdings Sdn Bhd. The price was at a 5.9% premium to Astro Malaysia’s IPO price of RM4.06 when it first listed in October 2003.The competitive environment notwithstanding, most analysts believe there is value in the media company as it has lost about 30% of its value in the past year. CIMB Equity Research analyst Kamarul Anwar believes regulatory intervention to block access to illegal channels will be a positive catalyst for Astro Malaysia.He has an “add” call for Astro Malaysia with a target price of RM1.75, citing its strong yield of 6.4% as a positive. Most analysts have the same view, with 11 “buy” and seven “hold” calls. The average target price is RM1.81, indicating a return potential of 9.7%.At the recent Kuala Lumpur Digital Content Anti-Piracy Summit, Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo suggested that all related agencies should be placed under one ministry to combat digital piracy.While it is too early to tell which of the companies under Khazanah’s commercial fund would be deemed “low hanging fruit” under its new mandate, the fresh direction points to interesting times for the Malaysian capital market, although sceptics observe that there had already been a few rounds of heightened activity under the previous administrations.Proponents of Khazanah divesting its stake in government-linked companies will point to a higher free float as a positive for the domestic equities market. The sovereign wealth fund will also have more firepower to increase its international exposure and diversify its investments.The larger liquidity could spur the capital market, which has remained largely stagnant over the last two to three years. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/time-best-performer-khazanahs-commercial-pool,"2019-05-01 20:06:15"
337,"March 04, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TM,"The State of the Nation: EPF beats expectations on dividend and impairment ","IT would seem that the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) — the statutory guardian of the retirement kitty of private-sector wage earners — is perpetually stuck between a rock and a hard place. After proving critics wrong by announcing a stellar dividend despite the challenging operating environment last year, speculation has turned to how it managed the feat.On Feb 16, the EPF declared a 6.15% dividend for its conventional portfolio and 5.9% for Simpanan Shariah — way above the speculated low of four plus per cent, purportedly on sizeable write-downs, given how badly equities performed last year.Some critics pointed to 2016 when the EPF had a RM8.18 billion net impairment loss. That year, the dividend dipped to 5.7% from 6.4% in 2015 when net impairment was RM3.07 billion.Most of the impairment (net of any write-backs) was from listed financial assets with a small portion coming from unlisted subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. In 2015, the EPF saw a RM321 million net write-back on the unlisted investments that negated part of the RM3.4 billion net impairment on its listed financial assets.Yet based on the 2018 preliminary figures released by the EPF last Monday, the implied net impairment to its total income for the year was little changed from the RM3 billion plus seen in 2015 and 2017.For 2018, the EPF’s gross investment income was RM50.88 billion while total dividend payout was RM47.32 billion. It is not immediately known whether the EPF’s 2018 total income benefited from non-investment income. Audited accounts will be out in April when its 2018 annual report is released.When asked, CEO Tunku Alizakri Alias declines to disclose the size of the impairment for 2018, noting that the year’s accounts still needed to be audited by the Auditor-General’s Department. Nonetheless, he assures that the EPF “has always insisted on adhering to global best practices”, had implemented the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standard 9 (MFRS 9) since Jan 1, 2018, and had indicated as much when announcing its results for the first, second and third quarters of last year.“Under MFRS 9, all listed equity instruments have to be marked-to-market and recognised at fair value to reflect the actual market price of the assets,” Alizakri explains, dismissing as “mere speculation” that a change in accounting treatment boosted the EPF’s performance.“To further allay any misgivings, we also have in place strict cut-loss policies governing our equities to ensure the continued health of our balance sheet. Thus to allude that the EPF had arbitrarily decided to not carry out impairment on its listed equities in order to declare a higher dividend for 2018 is just not true,” he adds.As the EPF looks at investments from a long-term horizon, Alizakri says the retirement savings fund chose to classify its equity instruments using the Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) method as Fair Value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) would expose it to volatility in earnings, especially due to temporary market cycles.While the EPF no longer recognises impairment or capital gains on disposal on its listed equity holdings in its statement of profit and loss, adjustments are still made to its retained earnings to reflect the correct worth of its assets.“There has never been, and there must never be, any political pressure or undue influence on the EPF to declare dividend figures,” Alizakri says, adding that this sentiment extends to “all aspects” of the EPF’s operational and investment activities.“Everything we do is towards meeting our mandate to safeguard and grow our members’ savings as well as deliver excellent services. We unequivocally state that the EPF, as a statutory body with a strong set of governance structures, is apolitically proud to be able to serve our members who represent all races and political affiliations,” he comments. “The EPF has strict governance in ensuring that the dividend declared is in accordance with our long-established policies and the relevant accounting standards. The decision on dividend rates has to go through various committees, including the Board Audit Committee, the Investment Panel and the EPF Board before they can be declared.”According to him, the EPF declares its annual dividend payout based solely on its net realised income for the year, which is derived from total gross realised income after deducting net impairment on financial assets (except listed equities), unrealised gains or losses from inter-company transactions, investment expenses, operating expenditure, statutory charges as well as dividend on withdrawals. “Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily declare higher dividends.”It is not immediately known if there were any sizeable gains or losses from the EPF’s involvement in the Battersea redevelopment project, where Apple Inc’s London headquarters will reportedly be based from late-2020 or early-2021. There were genuine concerns over rising costs and thinner project development margins, especially following a delay in the Northern Line rail extension and opening of a new station that was supposed to drive more traffic to Battersea.The EPF took a 20% stake in the Battersea project in 2012 with S P Setia Bhd and Sime Darby Property Bhd each taking 40%. Last December, PNB-Kwasa International 2 — which is 35% owned by the EPF and 65% by Permodalan Nasional Bhd — agreed to pay £1.583 billion (RM8.35 billion) for S P Setia and Sime Darby’s stake in Battersea Phase 2 Holding Co Ltd. Boost from overseas allocationStill, the EPF’s success in generating income overseas is a key reason it was able to pay strong dividends in recent years. In 2015, for instance, 48% of the EPF’s earnings were from overseas despite having only 25% of its assets invested outside Malaysia.In 2017, when the EPF paid its highest dividend in 21 years of 6.9%, overseas income made up 41.45% of gross investment income (GII) despite global assets making up only 28% of its assets. In other words, foreign income alone was enough to pay more than 3% dividend to all members in 2017.While the EPF’s earnings from abroad were not so high last year, foreign investment across all asset classes still contributed 37.52% to its gross investment income. While the proportion of its foreign assets fell to 26.7% last year from 28% in 2017, the absolute value was still estimated to be about RM1 billion higher year on year.Its estimated income of about RM19.1 billion from abroad last year was enough to pay about 2.5% dividends to all EPF members — down from 3.1% or RM22 billion in 2017 — which is also reflected in the year-on-year decline in the EPF’s conventional dividend of 6.15% last year versus 6.9% in 2017. Dividend for Simpanan Shariah also slipped to 5.9% last year from 6.4% in 2017. Some 55% to 60% of income from equities since 2013The EPF’s success in equities investment is the other factor supporting its strong dividends in recent years. Before 2010, less than one-third of its assets were in equities, which at most generated 35% of gross investment income. From the 27% allocation for 2009 equities rose to as much as 44% of the EPF’s asset allocation in 2015 before easing to 39.1% last year.Not only did the proportion of asset allocation to equities decline to 39.1% last year from 42.2% in 2017, it was the first time in at least 15 years that there was a year-on-year decline in the absolute amount of investments the EPF had in equities to about RM326.3 billion last year from RM334.2 billion in 2017.It is not known if the significant decline in several top local EPF holdings had any bearing on these figures.At the time of writing, the EPF had not released its top 30 equity holdings as at Dec 31, 2018, but a simplistic tabulation of 35 stocks that were among the EPF’s top 30 holdings in the past four quarters and its shareholding level from stock exchange filings as at end-2018, shows that the value of the 35 stocks had fallen roughly RM7.5 billion year on year as at end-2018 — if one were to make a simplistic assumption that its shareholding was the same as a year ago. The largest declines were in Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Sime Darby Plantations Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd, Digi.com Bhd and Maxis Bhd while the largest gains were in Public Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, PPB Group Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd.The EPF did not disclose the size of its steady income stream for last year, which was enough to pay nearly half of its dividend payout for 2017, back-of-the-envelope calculations show.Last year, the EPF’s gross investment income stood at RM46.26 billion (conventional) and RM4.62 billion (shariah), adding up to RM50.88 billion. This was slightly below the 2017 figures of RM48.54 billion (conventional) and RM4.6 billion (shariah), for a total of RM53.14 billion.Total dividend for last year was RM47.32 billion (conventional: RM43 billion, shariah: RM4.32 billion), lower than 2017’s RM48.13 billion (conventional: RM44.15 billion, shariah: RM3.98 billion). The amount needed to pay every 1% of dividend increased from RM7.02 billion in 2017 to RM7.72 billion last year.It is impossible to please everybody, yet Alizakri hopes that those who are disappointed with the EPF’s dividend for last year measure the fund’s performance against the very challenging market conditions it faced, especially in 4Q2018. The 6.15% dividend (conventional) is 3.65% above its target of at least 2.5% nominal dividend and 3.93% above its second target of delivering at least 2% real dividend on a rolling three-year basis.“We have been able to not only preserve but also enhance the value of our members’ savings by 87.5% through the dividends that we have distributed over the past 18 years (since 2000). In other words, if you had placed RM1,000 in savings with the EPF on Jan 1, 2000, the value of your savings on Dec 31, 2018, would have grown to RM1,875. If you had held on to your cash at home, you would have seen an erosion of that same amount of money by 35.2% to be worth only RM648 today,” he says.For members hoping to see stronger EPF dividends for this year, Alizakri has this to say: “I wish I had the power to guarantee that EPF dividends will be stronger this year as I would then have the power to dictate world events and influence global markets. The only promise I can give you is that we have in place solid processes and the best people to ensure that the EPF is in a position to take advantage of opportunities as well as to manage any crisis in as quick and efficient a manner as possible. Our members can also be further comforted that our robust and time-proven Strategic Asset Allocation will equip us with the ability to withstand short-term volatility and deliver a commendable performance to our members.” ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/state-nation-epf-beats-expectations-dividend-and-impairment,"2019-05-01 20:06:16"
338,"February 28, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TM,"Cover Story: Man with a mandate","CONTRARY to speculation, Khazanah Nasional Bhd is not being shut down. Talk that Khazanah might be liquidated was why congratulations was not the first word that came to mind for many when Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan was plucked out of the highly successful Employees Provident Fund to fill the managing director’s seat at Khazanah in early August last year.Not only was it about a week after the entire Khazanah board had tendered their resignation, but Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had lamented how the sovereign wealth fund he set up in 1993 had veered away from its original purpose.One does not need a degree from Oxford or master’s from Cambridge, like Shahril has,  to know the 48-year-old needs to know upfront what Mahathir expects of him and Khazanah.“He just wanted assurance that I would be able to deliver in terms of success for Khazanah in the same way that I’ve done in the past for, say, EPF,” Shahril tells The Edge.Mahathir was also the prime minister when Shahril first came under Corporate Malaysia’s spotlight 18 years ago when he and Datuk Abdul Rahman Ahmad — now Permodalan Nasional Bhd president and CEO — were brought in to restructure the then debt-laden Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) in 2001.What is perhaps Shahril’s largest feat to date is how he successfully rebalanced the EPF’s portfolio of assets to earn a lot more income than what they would have earned had he not directed more money outside Malaysia into dividend-paying stocks as well as alternative investments such as real estate and infrastructure, which provide a steady stream of income without taking on excessive risks.The portfolio rebalancing allowed the EPF to pay the highest dividend rate in 21 years last year of 6.9%, despite the amount required to pay 1% dividend having doubled from RM3.43 billion when he joined the EPF as deputy CEO of investments in November 2009 to RM7.02 billion in 2017. Shahril was EPF CEO from April 2013 until the Aug 3 announcement stating he would report for duty at Khazanah on Aug 20, 2018.Now, Shahril will be expected to rebalance Khazanah’s portfolio — not short-term selling of assets or shares to fill government coffers — but to turn Khazanah into a significant income generator for Malaysia — one that can sustainably supplement the federal government’s annual budget.“There has been this misconception that we are selling because the government needs money. Actually, that is not quite true. We are actually doing some disposals in order to rationalise the portfolio. For instance, we are highly concentrated in terms of our Malaysian exposure. From a more balanced point of view, we really should have more global exposure,” Shahril explains.“What we’re trying to do is to give more certainty to what we can deliver for government budgeting purposes. That commitment of about RM1 billion [dividend] a year is that certainty that we’re giving them,” he adds, explaining that the bulk of proceeds from any divestment stays in Khazanah for reinvestment to restructure its portfolio for longer-term gains.“As we restructure the portfolio and the portfolio starts to provide and generate the kind of returns that we think it should over the long term, that would give us more capacity, at that point in time, to look at a higher dividend to the government.”Indeed, the RM1 billion dividend the government expects from it for 2019 was what Khazanah paid the government in 2017, and lower than the RM1.5 billion Shahril said Khazanah paid in 2018. [It is understood that there is a discrepancy between the dividend Khazanah reports and what is stated under the government’s income records as the latter is prepared using cash accounting rather than accrual accounting.]Across the Causeway, Singapore’s annual budget has been enjoying what it calls a net income return contribution (NIRC) since 2000,  which covered nearly 20% of the city state’s government expenses last year.  The NIRC includes 50% net investment returns from Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, GIC Pte Ltd and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.GIC and Temasek — with US$390 billion and US$375 billion assets under management (AUM) respectively — are the world’s eighth and ninth largest sovereign wealth funds, according to data from the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) Institute. GIC manages Singapore’s government reserves while Temasek is Singapore’s investment arm. SWF ranks Khazanah at No 25 with US$38.7 billion.According to Shahril, the biggest difference between Khazanah’s old and new mandate is “clarity on the long-term goal and vision”.Going forward, Khazanah’s portfolio will have a 70:30 split, with 70% of its assets falling under the “commercial” basket that is used to fulfil its long-term asset growth target. The remaining 30% will be its “strategic” basket, which, he says, fulfils a strategic role in the country’s development and encompasses Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airlines Bhd as well as Iskandar Investment Bhd.That leaves Khazanah’s previous core holdings such as Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd and its remaining 26% stake in IHH Healthcare Bhd in the “commercial” pool that it will monetise, if the right value exists. Citing its deal with Mitsui & Co on IHH, Shahril assures other investors that Khazanah will not make any move that is counterproductive to its own portfolio value.He also says Khazanah cannot simply apply a blanket 15% to 25% cap to all its holdings “because a lot depends on the maturity of the asset as well as the opportunity that exists for us to do some monetisation” but it will be actively assessing its portfolio going forward to reap the best possible benefits for Malaysia.Given the current portfolio constraints, Khazanah is looking at achieving 3% returns above inflation over a rolling five-year period, a target that will be relooked over time as the portfolio is reshaped — a journey that Shahril reckons could take seven to 10 years. Khazanah will also be managing costs more tightly. One example is that it did not need to pay investment banking fees for its IHH deal with Mitsui because the capability exists in-house.  For more on what he has to say about Khazanah’s new mandate, read the following interview: The Edge: How have your past six months at Khazanah been? What is your mandate and is it clear? Are your money-making skills going to be put to good use?Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan: When I stepped in at the end of August last year, it was a fairly abrupt shift from my previous position at EPF. But given that the Malaysian market is not that big and EPF and Khazanah have had many dealings in the past, the transition was fairly short. Obviously, I already knew quite a lot of people at Khazanah and we’d done some common investments in the past. Also, we more or less knew what was happening at Khazanah, so I would say it was a fairly steep learning curve in terms of the time that we had. But it was not something that was impossible to do, given that there was a lot of knowledge coming in already.So, the first thing that was quite apparent, that really needed to happen, I think, was to ensure that the new board and new government in place had a clear understanding of what Khazanah’s vision or mandate was going to be. I think, really, that’s the most important thing that needs to be upfront because for any organisation, if you’re not clear about what the expectations are or what the mandate is, it is very hard to work on the policies within the firm to take it forward.So, we worked on that upfront and I think we got a lot of clarity very early on in terms of my discussions with the government and the new board. By December, when we had our formal strategy review as well as our outlook for 2019, we formulated a very clear strategy, which was adopted [approved] by our board, so that’s the new Khazanah mandate.The Khazanah mandate is really twofold. One, Khazanah essentially should function like a traditional sovereign wealth fund for other countries, which is focused on the long-term growth of its assets on behalf of and for the benefit of all Malaysians over generations. So, that’s a much longer-term goal, which is about growth and about making sure that on a risk-adjusted basis, we reach the kind of targets and returns that we set for ourselves. But we also recognise the fact that Khazanah, over the years, has also played a developmental role, that is a strategic role for the government, and that continues as well. And that is focused really on our strategic side, about making the right investments and working with the government on regulations and the environment to make sure that beyond just a commercial objective, those strategic investments also fulfil a role in creating the right atmosphere and right infrastructure for Malaysia’s development and economic growth.When we look at that, essentially we think of Khazanah as having two pools of assets. One pool is focused on the long-term asset growth target. Internally, we call it our commercial fund. The other pool of assets — which focuses on Khazanah’s strategic role of helping develop Malaysia — is our strategic fund. The split between the two pools is roughly 70:30 — 70% is focused on long-term asset growth for Malaysians while 30% is focused on the strategic role that we reinforce. What is the biggest difference between the old and new mandates?It is clarity on Khazanah’s long-term goal and vision. The previous management was very focused on GLC (government-linked company) transformation and Khazanah did a fantastic job of raising the standard of the GLCs it was invested in and championing the regionalisation of Malaysian companies — with a lot of success. And if we look at the last 12 years or so, before I stepped in, it had seen a lot of success in terms of achieving those goals but really, as the organisation matures, you have to move forward because a lot of that work is done. We can’t keep focusing on that work; from the point of view of effort versus returns, most of it has been achieved but you will be on a path of diminishing returns if you keep focusing on the same strategy. I think that’s basically something that Khazanah itself recognises. To be fair, even before I stepped in, they’d already started thinking about taking all these steps, which is why it was quite easy to start the transition. Because really, it is about articulating where we go as an organisation. Khazanah’s pool of assets is fairly limited, at RM100-plus billion, and there is speculation that it will sell a lot of those assets and give the money back to the government. Will Khazanah be given any leeway in keeping some of the funds from monetising its assets and investing that for longer-term growth and returns? Singapore, for instance, has NIRC (net investment return contribution), which contributes about 20% to the government’s budget …One of the things we’ve worked on under the strategy adopted by the board is that when we look at Khazanah’s pool of assets and at our own requirements to restructure and balance the portfolio, we have fairly clear guidelines internally that for every divestment we make, a certain portion goes towards debt repayment, a certain portion towards reinvestment and from a government point of view, we now have a clear dividend policy. Last year, we committed about RM1 billion plus to the government as dividend and that is to be an ongoing and steady dividend policy. RM1 billion (dividend) every year?Roughly RM1 billion a year. If you look at the asset rationalisation that we’ve been doing, a lot of it is towards the fact that as we become a more mature commercial fund, the proceeds from the divestment are used for restructuring the portfolio.There is this misconception that we’re selling because the government needs money. That is not quite true. We are actually doing some disposals to rationalise the portfolio. If you look at our portfolio, quite clearly, there is some imbalance. For instance, we are highly concentrated in terms of our Malaysian exposure. From a more balanced point of view, we really should have more global exposure.Similarly, our concentration in certain companies, we felt basically that the time has come for us to actually look at diversifying our exposure. For instance, we did that IHH Healthcare transaction last year. That is a template for how we basically view the portfolio. When the opportunity arises for us to rationalise or dispose of certain assets, we will only do so if the value is right and the proceeds are used to reinvest and rebalance the portfolio.I think people tend to misunderstand because we (Khazanah) are owned by the government. They seem to think that every time we sell an asset, the proceeds go straight to the government. The proceeds actually stay in Khazanah for the purpose of reinvestment because its longer-term goal is to grow that pool of assets for the benefit of Malaysia as a whole.So, the dividend portion — yes, we have committed to a dividend policy to the government and that is reflected in the government’s budget itself where RM1 billion or so is anticipated from Khazanah on a yearly basis.What we’re trying to do is to give more certainty to what we can deliver for government budgeting purposes. That commitment of about RM1 billion a year is that certainty that we’re giving the government. Is that on an increasing basis, until you can get more? When do you think Khazanah can give more?The plan is that as we restructure the portfolio and it starts to generate the kind of returns we think it should over the long term, that would give us more capacity. At that point, we will look at a higher dividend to the government.But the focus right now is to restructure the portfolio because to have a proper balance between our exposure and the risks we’re taking, a lot of reinvestment needs to be done to restructure the portfolio now. So, there is no rush to sell assets?Not at all. There will come opportunities where it makes sense for us to consider a sale. IHH Healthcare was obviously one of those, where basically we’ve done a lot of work in terms of building up that regional champion and our partner Mitsui is very keen to play a bigger role in the company and we are quite happy to let it do so. So, we remain a partner in the company as well and we will keep working with Mitsui to grow the company. Khazanah was reported to be looking to keep only 15% to 25% stakes in companies and disposing of the rest to raise cash for the nation’s coffers …That story was not directly sourced from us (Khazanah), so there are some accuracy issues. So, there is no 15% to 25% (equity holding) limit? A number of your holdings have breached that level: 66% in UEM Sunrise, 37% in Axiata, 33% in MAHB, 27% in CIMB ...When you look at each of our assets, it is hard to apply a blanket rule like that because a lot depends on the maturity of the asset as well as the opportunity that exists for us to do some monetisation.In some cases, like IHH Healthcare, we would do a partial sale because we still believe in the long-term future of the asset. But like any good portfolio manager, when the opportunity exists for you to take some of your money because you’re clearly sitting on some fairly decent gains, you should exercise the financial discipline to do so and rebalance the portfolio. Otherwise, as the value of the asset keeps growing, it takes up a larger proportion of your total portfolio and from a risk-adjusted basis, it becomes a bit more difficult to justify having so many of your eggs in one basket.There will be opportunities for us to do a total sale — sometimes, if we feel that we’ve brought it as far as we think we can and that it might be better off in somebody else’s hands, and we can get good value for it, then we do a total sale. In some cases, like IHH Healthcare, we do a partial sale. In some instances, we might just continue to hold what we have today if we believe there is better value upside for us in doing so. So, it is not wise to assume that a blanket rule is applied to everything because it doesn’t make sense in a lot of cases. Will Khazanah be initiating more deals [to create/unlock value], such as merging companies or exercises like the airport REIT [which the government announced when tabling Budget 2019]?Depending on the entity and the market it is operating in, there are different opportunities. In some cases, a merger may be the best solution in terms of creating more value for us. In others, it may just be an outright sale. In yet others, it may purely be a focus on organic growth or if we think there are opportunities for us to put more money into the business for it to invest or to grow organically. It is very hard to over-generalise this. You would have seen many different forms in the market, through which value creation can take place. Are you going to merge Axiata with other companies — Telekom or perhaps Astro? Is that being considered or does its current [low] valuation make it very difficult?When we talk about mergers, you also have to be very careful about your own market position. I’m not talking about any company in particular but you have to also look at the fact that mergers sometimes may not be the solution because whenever you do a merger of two entities, you always have the problem of culture and integration. And that’s why from my point of view, you should always look at merger as a solution very, very carefully. Sometimes, those benefits, while they look good on paper, may actually be very difficult to achieve. A lot of the time when you look at a merger as a value creator, you are looking at cost synergies. Invariably, when you look at past mergers, those cost synergies become difficult to achieve because of inherent legacies or inherent problems, so you have to be very careful about pushing mergers as the main form of value creation. So, is there low-hanging fruit that you’re looking to tackle first?Yes, obviously, when we look at the portfolio, there are a number of things that we think we can do in terms of value creation and we will be actively pursuing that throughout the rest of this year. So, yes, there are a few opportunities, I think, but given market sensitivities, we can’t really discuss them in detail but we will make announcements as they come. From your portfolio review, how big a percentage of the assets are ripe for monetisation? Any non-performing assets that Khazanah needs to hive off?Clearly, in any portfolio, you always look at the return at portfolio level, as a whole. Within the portfolio, there are always those that are outperforming and those that are underperforming. So, Khazanah is no different. There are assets, which are clearly not performing to expectation.So, one of the things we hope to instill in Khazanah going forward is a much sharper attitude towards cutting losses early or getting out of situations before they become worse. That’s always one of the fundamental difficulties for any asset manager or portfolio manager, which is that sometimes, you tend to fall in love with the asset or investment. You have got to have more discipline in terms of reducing your losses early and accepting the fact that you can’t win them all. No portfolio manager has 100% success in investment. It is mathematically impossible but the more successful managers have the right culture in place, which allows them to basically identify losers or underperforming assets and make decisions fast enough to redeploy the capital into other assets where you have better opportunities.Similarly here in Khazanah, we are in the midst of looking at those underperforming assets and where we feel there is really no point in continuing — some foreign, some local. Even our global assets, we’ve had some real winners over the last year or so. We had, for instance, our investment in companies like FarFetch and Phunware, which have gone for listing and done well. Similarly, some of those tech investments — there’s always the danger of early-stage investment. You are bound to have some failures, and with those failures, we are just going to draw the line; we’re not going to pump in any more money because there is absolutely no point in good money chasing bad money. One of the assets that need a lot of money is Malaysia Airlines. Is it still going to be on Khazanah’s books?Yes. It is part of our strategic portfolio. In terms of commercial returns, we are encouraging the Malaysia Airlines board and management to close the gap in commercial outcome, but beyond that, Malaysia Airlines, for a very long time, also served a fundamental purpose for the Malaysian economy in terms of being the national carrier and promoting tourism, there are a lot of intangible and commercial benefits, which don’t necessarily accrue to the airline itself but to the country. This is why it sits in our strategic basket.Obviously, I think a lot more can be done to improve the commercial outcome of the airline itself but we have to recognise that there is — at this point in time and for a lot of national airlines around the world — a cost to maintain the benefit to the economy as a whole in terms of linkages and trade and so on. The key here is for the Malaysia Airlines board and management to think through and accept the fact that it is an extremely competitive world out there. They have to find a way to actually compete and do it commercially. Does this mean there could be additional help, apart from the previous plan that was announced?Well, they are in the midst of a review of the strategic plan they’ve in place and quite clearly, there are elements of the strategy that have worked and those that haven’t. What we’re asking them to focus on is that you have to be realistic to see what is working and what is not. For what is not working, you might as well do something different because there is really no point in trying to do the same thing over and over again, if it is really not working.So, we are waiting for them to come back to us. The onus is on the management and board to come back to the shareholders and say, ‘Look, we think this is going to be a more viable strategy’. Then, we will look at it and see whether or not we agree. There is talk that the RM6 billion is not enough and that it is up to the management and board to convince Khazanah that they are worth additional support and money until they make it ...Like I said, we’re waiting for them to come back to us. There is no point in pursuing a course of action that is not going to work in this business climate. If it is obviously not going to work, why do it? So, let’s wait and see.I think there are elements that they are already implementing, which have a better chance of success. They have launched AMAL, which is a specialised service for umrah and haj. That looks decent as a strategy. It plays to one of their competitive strengths. We’re asking them, ‘If you can think of things like AMAL, then surely you can think of strategies for your other businesses that are not performing well and look at doing something different?’ When are they due to come back on the plan?Hopefully, in a very short period of time. The aviation sector has become very complex because of the competition and quite clearly in Malaysia, you have a very clear market leader in low-cost airlines, which is AirAsia. The reality is that AirAsia now dominates that segment. So, the problem we’re facing is that it is very different from 20 years ago, when Malaysia Airlines was a monopoly. That’s not going to happen ever again. There is no point in pining for the good old days. You have to accept reality and move on. You mentioned a 70:30 split and Malaysia Airlines sits in the 30% (strategic) basket. Can we generalise and say that the 30% comprises the not-for-sale assets and whatever is in the 70%, if its potential is maxed out, you will just sell it?Yeah, if you look at it that way. I’ll be very frank with you. The strategic side encompasses TM, Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia Airports, our holdings in Malaysia Airlines, Iskandar, which is a catalytic development down south, and one or two small pieces in there like our tourism and resort business, which again, is a catalytic development for Malaysia in terms of encouraging growth in that area. Really, everything else is in our commercial side. So Axiata, UEM, Astro and CIMB … are in the 70%?Axiata, UEM Group, Astro, CIMB … that’s in our commercial fund. Our view, essentially, is that from a control point of view and from an influence point of view, we will remain focused in our strategic basket because those are the companies that I think makes more sense for us to spend time with [their] board and management in terms of regulatory outcomes because those have a bigger impact on Malaysia’s economy and infrastructure development. For the rest, really, the government has no interest or business influencing or being in control of private hospitals, or a commercial bank or a property development or building services. I think the right path, and our board agrees, is that these are businesses that really do not need government ownership or management. They should really be free to go and do their own thing. We will be purely an investor.As you yourself said, we have to recognise that when the right opportunity comes, we will look at whether we can create value for Khazanah by either disposing, merging or organic growth. So, it is fully a portfolio-based approach to those investments. We have heard the phrase ‘financial discipline’ a few times and you mentioned it alongside ‘loving the asset’ too much. Is that one of the shortcomings you found when you came in?I wouldn’t say it is a shortcoming. I think basically, it is just a natural path. Khazanah for the past 12 years has been focusing on revamping these companies and we’ve done a great job in terms of revamping. When you look at the amount of value created for companies like TM, Tenaga and CIMB over the last 10 to 12 years, it has been fantastic, right?Obviously, as the organisation matures, we have to recognise the fact that we’ve done our part. We now have professional boards, professional management at these companies. The onus now rests on those boards and managements to basically keep that value creation growing. Our role then shifts, as far as those companies are concerned, towards essentially being a capital allocator.If we feel that the nation’s capital, Khazanah’s assets, are best deployed in those companies, they will continue to be deployed in those companies. If there are other opportunities, we will redeploy somewhere else because the main goal of Khazanah going forward is really about long-term growth of our assets. If that long-term growth can be achieved by staying with these companies, fine. If not, we should really have the discipline to say we’ve taken it as far as we can, it’s time to take that money and the profits that we’ve made and redeploy them somewhere else. Is there a cap for Khazanah when it comes to foreign investments?There’s not so much a cap. If you look at our portfolio, we are short on global assets. The reason for that is we’ve always been very mindful … Traditionally, the GLICs [government-linked investment companies] have had an outsized presence in Malaysia, especially on Bursa Malaysia. When Khazanah looks at it, our point of view is basically, we already have EPF and PNB. They are very big local investors and rightly so because on their account are Malaysian holders who are expecting decent ringgit outcomes [returns].If the focus is really on long-term asset growth, then we have to have a more balanced portfolio that looks at both Malaysia as well as globally on the commercial side. The strategic side will always be Malaysia-focused, but on the commercial side, it needs to be more balanced in order to provide the right risk-adjusted returns. What kind of global assets are you looking at?It will be in line with our risk-return profile. The difference from say, the EPF — which has capital stability as one of its core goals and has a fairly large allocation towards debt and fixed income — is that Khazanah’s focus is more on growth. We are much more heavily focused on equities, a mix of both public as well as private equities.Our asset allocation going forward is roughly going to be about 60% public equities, 30% private equities and 10% real assets.The reason for that is we don’t have individual accounts to worry about but we focus more on longer-term growth, so the right measure for a fund like Khazanah — for our commercial fund — is effectively an inflation plus strategy measured over a rolling, say, five-year period. That’s really the focus we are working on and that’s what we’re going with. You say you are going to increase your overseas presence. Where is the ideal threshold?That will come over time. It’s not as easy as saying we’re going to do it because the bulk of our assets are still Malaysia-focused.When I mentioned that we need to rebalance the portfolio, essentially we need to rebalance it towards being more global. IHH Healthcare Bhd is a good example. A large portion of the money from the transaction will go towards our global exposures. We will rebalance gradually over time.We think, honestly, from where our portfolio is and where the markets are, you’re probably looking at a seven to 10-year journey before we actually get to that ideal situation. We are talking about a capital outflow over time?Yeah, very gradual. Over a seven to 10-year period, it’s something that will allow that growth in global assets. So right now, it is like 30%?We are less than that actually, we are only about 15%. So your contract is for five or 10 years?No, CEO contracts should never be that long. My contract is only for three years from Aug 20, 2018. Back to dividends. The number was RM1.5 billion last year and it’s RM1 billion this year. How does Khazanah decide on the amount? Petronas, for instance … there is their net income. If the oil price is above US$70 a barrel, people know Petronas is in a good position to pay more dividends. In Khazanah’s case, how do you assess whether you’re in a position to pay more?As part of our strategic review, we have an internal dividend policy in place and that looks forward for the year. We already know what’s in our pipeline in terms of what we are planning to do or what is already on the way. We have a fairly decent idea of the kind of proceeds we will be generating and a percentage of that will be for dividends. What’s the percentage?It is roughly about 20% of the net proceeds from our transactions and the deals we’ve done. You’re not under pressure from the government to declare higher dividends?To be fair, I think the government understands there is always a trade-off between short-term dividends versus long-term portfolio rebalancing. There is a danger that if you try to extract too much money upfront, it leaves very little money for rebalancing the portfolio and that would then affect the long-term viability of Khazanah and the portfolio itself.So, one of the things that we’ve been very eager to do is have that discussion and emphasise basically the fact that you do need to allow space for that rebalancing, which would then allow you to, in future years, have a better outcome as far as dividends are concerned. Otherwise, what happens when you’re too short-termish and try to extract money from the portfolio, you are basically jeopardising that ultimate objective. The government understands the position?Yes, and that’s why our projected dividends for this year is roughly RM1 billion. The 20% is from disposal, or is it after it is in your books?When we look at net proceeds, obviously we have a cost to run Khazanah as well, so while we focus on the proceeds portion, one of the key objectives that we will be looking at here is also making Khazanah more cost-efficient. When we look at that, we have to benchmark properly against other similar funds. The whole idea is that we should be running at roughly 30 basis points (bps) for AUM (assets under management). We were running at higher than that in the last few years. How much higher?Probably 15bps to 20bps higher. So, one of the key things we are focusing on this year is to drive down running costs. Are you going to shut down some of the regional offices or downsize?Obviously, we are reviewing a lot of our cost structure where it makes sense. It has to be appropriate to our objective as well, what we intend to do in terms of redeployment. So yes, in some instances, we will downsize our operations. That’s only natural. In certain areas, the cost may not justify what we’re trying to achieve. It seems that the prime minister is not so happy that some officers, including those in Khazanah, were being paid at investment banker’s scale. Has there been any feedback from the Prime Minister’s Department on salaries and remuneration?One of the key things when looking at remuneration is the fact that it has got to commensurate with the type of jobs and skills that we want to attract. From my point of view, you also have to be mindful that you’re expecting these people to generate value for you. You have to pay people appropriately.I do agree that, basically, we shouldn’t have excessive remuneration. In any organisation, that just doesn’t make sense, but you need to pay people for the kind of value that they are bringing.Generally, when we look at remuneration, it is in line with the financial industry. So, obviously, if you compare it to maybe a pure government-type agency, it would not be like that. But the whole idea is if you’re expecting people from investment banking or asset management to join you, then you have to basically provide them with a commensurating financial package. Otherwise, you’re not going to get them. It is the same for all fund managers, whether it is Khazanah, EPF and PNB. You are competing for a talent pool that is essentially mobile and that can go work in any investment bank or asset management house.The key difference with an entity like Khazanah is that we also have the element of national pride and national duty. So that helps, I think, in attracting a different kind of talent, those who wants to contribute to the country, who may not be focusing on remuneration as the No 1 objective. But to be fair to these people, you still have to pay them. You may not pay them at the top quartile of the financial industry but you’ve got to pay them at the average for them to come in. Did you have to take a pay cut to come in or are they banking on your love for country?Let’s put it this way lah, I’ve been doing national service for the last don’t know how many years now and I personally quite enjoy working and contributing towards this kind of organisation. So I’m one of those guys who have never been particularly motivated by remuneration. You’ve been here six months. Where is the fat in terms of cost?When you look at cost as a whole, there are elements where quite clearly, you can do a lot better. To be fair to the team here, they’ve already initiated those measures in the past. We are in the midst of doing full cost review. We think we can get to about 35bps this year. Is that coming from people or more [closing] offices?It’s a combination of a number of things. Some of it is fixed cost, office cost as well as infrastructure or system cost. Second is basically variable cost or deal cost. There we just need to be smarter about how we execute deals in order to reduce cost. IHH is a prime example. For the IHH transaction, everything was effectively in-house. So, we effectively didn’t have to pay investment bankers to do the deal. That capability does exist.Coming back to the issue of remuneration, it’s basically a balance between paying the right price to get the right people on board and then making sure that those people deliver value. In this case, the team basically in-housed the whole transaction, [the deal was done] without having to pay unnecessary investment banking fees. An early statement from Tun Mahathir, when the new government took over, was that Khazanah has veered away from its original objective. Have you had a chance to meet with the prime minister to clarify?Of course, he is the chairman of the board. He is fully involved in the discussion on the approval of the new strategy by the board. To be fair to him, he is correct. The Khazanah that was set up in the 1990s was a very different animal — it was effectively a holding company, holding shares for the government. But over the course of time, like all organisations, those objectives change over time.In the 2000s right to the time I took over, that objective then became about enhancing the value of those assets, instead of being just a passive holder of those assets. It became more active in actually creating value by getting the right values, right systems, into those companies, and that has been a success. And the government has actually benefited from that. The government has actually reaped the value increase of companies like TM, Tenaga, CIMB and the rest.Now, the new strategy reflects what Khazanah will become over the next few years. Khazanah has changed and, like all organisations, will continue to change as we develop and mature. From the earlier statements, it seems that the prime minister wanted Khazanah to change back to its original purpose. Was that the indication?The government has basically approved the strategy, the board has approved the strategy. That’s a reflection that Khazanah has got this new mandate and vision. We will execute this new mandate and vision. This vision is different from what it was two years ago, it is different from what it was 20 years ago, but I think it is the right vision and mandate for what Khazanah should be going forward for the country. One of the largest impediments for Khazanah is the limited fund size of less than RM200 billion. When it is split to 60:30:10, the pool is even smaller and you already have a basket of things that you can’t really move. Are you using these three years to expand the pool? Is there a chance of getting more from the government by saying, we can get this much returns, give us the money?One of the natural constraints, as you rightly pointed out, is unlike the more traditional sovereign wealth funds, we don’t have a ready pool of AUM [funds] coming into Khazanah. That’s why Khazanah, especially in the last 10 years, has grown through using some debt to fund new purchases and organically growing the value of those assets. That was the strategy that was put in place.Going forward, we recognise the fact that government finances are currently a bit constrained. They are doing some restructuring of their finances. To expect the government to be able to commit new assets over the short-term would be difficult but obviously, as we put this [new] strategy in place, over the long term, we will be working with the government to see whether there are opportunities for us to manage more assets. But that is something that is not a short-term priority. Short-term priority really is the portfolio rebalancing and restructuring and we will move forward with that first. On your new mandate, [one newswire] had the headline “More cash less control”.More cash is generally a bad idea because cash gives you little returns. So while it is a catchy headline, it is very bad from an investment point of view, unless you’re willing to have a large cash drag on your portfolio.We basically have two clear mandates. One is on the commercial side, which is on the bulk of our assets — it is really about long-term, inflation-adjusted growth for the country and that’s focused on delivering long-term asset growth for the nation.On the strategic side … while focusing on commercial returns, it is [also] making sure that those assets continue to perform their role of strategically of helping the country to grow the economy as well as providing the right regulatory environment for other players to participate and compete. In terms of cutting losses, do you find it easier to do in EPF or Khazanah?The asset mixes and the concentration risks are very different. The EPF has been operating as a portfolio investor for a very long time. It is actually easier for them [EPF] because concentration are very small, amounts may be big, but concentration as a percentage of the entity is very small.For Khazanah, because a lot of our assets are sticky or lumpy, even if you wanted to dispose, it is normally a much longer process because we have a lot more liquidity constraints, for instance. Given how much share prices have come down, and you need to raise cash to do some of the portfolio restructuring, are you thinking [along the lines] of, say, a share-backed exchangeable bond?Financial markets are very sophisticated now, there are many different ways we can monetise or generate the kind of liquidity that we need. We’re actually quite comfortable with where it is. Markets have come down and there is a significant loss in value, especially over the last one year, in a number of our core asset holdings for various reasons, sometimes due to very significant regulatory change, like in the case for TM, where values today basically reflect a very different regulatory and operating environment. So, when we look at the portfolio as a whole, there are some areas where we obviously have more leeway or latitude to try and do things. In some areas, a bit more constrained. We have to accept that. That’s why it is important to have a diversified portfolio, because that gives you more ability to adjust for market conditions. When a portfolio is overly concentrated, then you are a hostage to both the market as well as the operating environment. It sounds like you’re reshaping Khazanah to be a portfolio investor. How do you rank this particular challenge compared to previous challenges in your previous roles?Like I said, every role has different challenges. Here, I think the challenge is not so much one of size. Yes, size is a constraint. Actually, the biggest constraint is more liquidity and concentration of risk. That’s actually the biggest challenge. Not so much size.And that is something which has to be addressed carefully because obviously, when you are the largest shareholder of an entity, any move that you make can be counterproductive to your value. And therefore, you have to do transactions or investments in a way which basically makes sense to your holdings as a whole.IHH is a classic example. Before we did the IHH transaction, the IHH share price was languishing, due to various reasons, at a fairly low level. But as soon as we made that transaction, it was very clear to the market that it was one transaction we were going to do ... the share overhang disappeared, the transaction itself set a new benchmark in terms of where the market perceived value of IHH and the share price then rerated, which benefited the balance holdings that we have as well.So you have to be careful, I think, in structuring this kind of transaction to make sure that you’re not shooting yourself in the foot. So you’ll be looking for people or investors or strategic partners that would recognise value in your assets, right?Obviously. Because I think if you adopt a strategy of just trying to dispose into the market, one, you create a massive share overhang, especially given the fact that in some of these companies, you are the largest shareholder. If we try to do a market disposal, once we just signal the intention into the market that you are a seller, suddenly people look at the shares and say no point buying, there’s a giant block of shares waiting to come into the market.So, in some instances, you just have to be patient, you find the right deal, and then that right deal essentially addresses the share overhang issue, addresses the market valuation issue at the same time, and gives you basically the ability to monetise a portion. Do you have another partner [like Mitsui for IHH] for your other assets?Not at this time. Obviously, there are things we are looking at and some discussions we are having but like I said, we’ll make announcements as it happens. Some news reports mentioned Japanese money coming into Khazanah.I think maybe they drew from the fact that Mitsui had come in for IHH and kind of extended that line a bit further maybe. When you say inflation-adjusted growth, would it be the country’s projected GDP growth for a particular year plus inflation?What we’re looking at is basically average inflation over a rolling five year period plus 3%. That seems conservative [low] for a fund that’s focused on growthIt reflects the fact that our current portfolio is constrained in terms of what we can do. So over time, as the portfolio is reshaped, those targets would be reviewed and relooked at again. Otherwise, there is no point in setting an unachievable or unrealistic target.We have to be a realist. We have to work within the constraint of the portfolio today. Inflation plus 3%, I think, is a reasonable and achievable target, without necessitating us to take unnecessary risk, given the fact that we have constraints on how much we can actually move the portfolio at this point. As you rebalance your portfolio, will the Bumiputera equity factor be one that will shape that rebalancing process?There are always going to be opportunities for entrepreneurs or management teams to look at being part of the process. Khazanah has done that in the past as well, with Time dotCom and other companies. So we will always look at that as well. Part of the vision of Khazanah, in terms of national development as a whole is how we create the right entrepreneur class to participate in the economy. There will be opportunities but it would be dependent on what type of asset it is. Something that is very big, like an IHH, that’s going to be more difficult because that’s much more of an institutional-type asset. But I guess there are smaller pieces in our portfolio which may be sole businesses or solo line businesses, which we will give opportunities for entrepreneurs or maybe the management team to propose a buyout of those assets. Your 60:30:10, that’s the target in seven to 10 years. What does it look like now?Right now it’s very much public markets but within the public markets, it is very concentrated because the bulk of our assets are reflected in under 10 companies. So that’s why transactions like IHH are important. It allows us to derisk our portfolio a bit by taking some of the AUM out of a single company and reinvesting in a broader spectrum of stuff. So the whole idea, over the seven to 10 years, we need to restructure and do something that makes more sense in terms of achieving the objective. The private equity part will be the 30%. What is it now?10% or so. Real assets?Real assets are very small, about 5%. Will you be looking at more real estate deals, when you talk about real assets? Is that going to be faster or longer-term when you get more assets to manage from the government?No. As part of the portfolio restructuring, we will start to deploy money in the different areas. Certainly, over time, we will see a shift in that portfolio… Do you count PLUS as a real asset?PLUS is more of an infrastructure asset. It is kind of a hybrid, it sits somewhere between our private equity and real assets basket. Would you say Khazanah internally is well-equipped for a much heavier foreign presence in terms of investments?We have many good people here who are very focused on the investment part. We will do a bit of supplementing on that because, quite clearly, as we build capacity in things like public markets, we will build capacity there as well. We are pretty okay. You come from EPF, which has RM800 billion and now you have a portfolio constraint. Would you count this as your toughest job ever [to date]?Every job has its own challenges. So, obviously, managing RM800 billion has its own challenges, where do you find enough investments to fill that entire pot and do it in a way that you’re still managing risk and generating the right returns.Here, it is a slightly different challenge. The biggest challenge to Khazanah at this point in time is how do we restructure and rebalance the portfolio while maintaining financial discipline in terms of making sure we get the right value for any divestment that we do and at the same time, recognising the fact that we have to be faster in either cutting losses out or disposing non-viable assets.Skill-set wise, it is transferable. It is the same philosophies in terms of trying to make sure that people understand that risk and return needs to be managed.That is why the first real thing that we needed to do here is clearly understand what is the right vision and mandate moving forward. Once that is set, then you can work on other things, what is your risk appetite, what is your philosophy, what is the asset allocation strategies because all that flows from that part. And that part really is about crystallising the idea that Khazanah really has two mandates, and these two mandates require separate consideration about what’s right and suitable. Last year, during the annual review, Khazanah said you have a China portfolio and that made quite a bit of money. Are you going to dedicate more funds into something like that?China, for instance, has been a big success for us. What is more important going forward is understanding how that fits into the overall larger portfolio, making sure that we have the right risk-return on the portfolio as a whole and within the individual portfolio is making sure that we are not overly weighted on tech and venture cap versus, say, consumers, versus financials … The whole idea is that when you start to think through these issues, you want to achieve a better overall portfolio return for the amount of risk we are taking. How’s the staff morale since the change of guard?Well, obviously, as in any organisation, when you have a sudden change of leadership, there’s always going to be anxiety as well as uncertainty over what’s going to happen.Hopefully, I think with the new strategy in place, the board approvals have all been done and the fact that everybody in there is now working towards a strategy, at least the uncertainty as to where the firm is heading has been resolved. But like in any change of strategy, there is going to be some anxiety about whether the individuals themselves are capable of executing that strategy. But that’s something you can actually work on over time, so we’re just like, all the strategic changes that I’ve put into place, you have to focus on making sure that you’re also focused on the human capital part and the development part to make sure that people understand their role in the new strategy. What was the first thing that your chairman said to you in the first meeting?He just wanted assurance that I would be able to deliver, in terms of success, for Khazanah in the same way that I’ve done in the past for, say, EPF, in making sure that we can actually create the right strategy for the organisation, which will then deliver success for the organisation.So, really, I think more along the lines of just getting assurance that the right strategy will be thought of and that management will be redirected in the right way. So I think, that’s the first part, which is basically, management and board on the same page as to where the firm should be going.And that’s been done, so now I think there’s no more uncertainty or lack of clarity as to where the firm should be headed. It’s now all about execution. So, given that the airport REIT was announced in the budget, is that the first big deal happening this year?No, actually, on the airport side, I think — and this is something that you really have to discuss with Malaysia Airports more — but I would imagine that their focus really is on resolving the regulatory framework first.Because without a clear regulatory framework in place, you can’t actually do any kind of asset monetisation because investors coming in want to have certainty about what their returns are going to be like. So that needs to happen first. TM is in your strategic portfolio. Have you got clarity on what the government actually wants to do?Yes. TM and the ministry, I think, have been sitting down a lot to really narrow the gap on expectations and in terms of where the regulatory framework is going to go.As a shareholder, we will also engage with the ministry to make sure that they understand and appreciate the fact that for the right investment to happen in any industry, whether it’s telco or anything else, you need to have clarity on your regulatory side because investors need to know how much you’re going to make from the investments that you’re putting in.And if the regulations or regulatory framework is not conducive, then nobody’s going to fund anymore expansion, because from a calculation point of view, why would I fund a billion ringgit of capital into that industry if I’m not going to get the same kind of return as I would expect putting it somewhere else. So you’re not expected to do national service in terms of TM?No, you have to be very careful about that because I think these are all public-listed companies and there’s a very big market implication, as you’ve seen with TM, if investors lose confidence in the regulatory framework. And then what will happen is it becomes very hard to raise new money for the industry. Has this been communicated to the respective ministries?Yes, I think that ongoing engagement is happening all the time and, to be fair, obviously government will have its own policy objectives. I think the job of the companies operating in those spaces is to properly advise the regulators on what are the financial or market implications of the various options that they’re looking at.Ultimately, it rests with the government. And if the government decides that it wants to implement a particular policy direction, it’s really their prerogative, but they need to do so, I think, in full knowledge of all the financial and market implications.Ultimately, the regulators have the right to set a policy direction. But they need to be very aware of the implications. So, what can the market expect from Khazanah this year? Because when you announce last year’s results (on Feb 28), the numbers are probably not going to look so good.Yes we’re planning to do our annual announcement, probably at the end of the month or so, and generally speaking … the market’s been performing very badly and some of our companies, TM in particular, and Axiata, for instance, and the telco industry as a whole have been very badly hit by regulatory uncertainty. So that, of course, will have a very big negative impact on results, clearly, because the market itself was difficult last year. The number of transactions that Khazanah could execute last year was also very limited.So you’ll probably not see a great result from Khazanah, and you’re going to have to accept that it’s just market reality. But the whole point, I think, is that we’ll refocus on the rebalancing and the portfolio reconstruction and we’ll be looking forward to see what we can do. So we accept that 2018 was a difficult year and that’s only natural.One of the things that you probably know from my time at EPF is that I’m perfectly happy to be as transparent as possible on financial numbers and results. So, when the time comes at the end of the month, we’ll be as transparent as we can, and in terms of the results, it is what it is. M+S, what is the latest news?As you would have seen from various news reports, M+S is engaging in a process on its Duo assets and that process is ongoing right now, so I’m not really at liberty to talk too much about what’s happening in that process, but effectively if that process concludes, they’ll make the right announcements. Sounds like all possibilities are still relatively open for Malaysia Airlines if they can come up with a plan that convinces Khazanah. But if they continue to struggle, like you said a lot of national carriers are struggling around the world, if they continue to struggle and cannot find the right plan, can or will Khazanah eventually draw a line somewhere?Well, ultimately, I think the right question to ask — and this ultimately is a policy decision that will be made by the government — is how valuable are the intangible benefits that a national airline provides to the country. And to what extent are you willing to keep investing in a company to enjoy those intangible benefits, even the company itself, the airline itself may not enjoy the commercial benefits.Because the reality is that for every dollar of tourist spend or business spend that Malaysia Airlines can bring into the country, that’s a dollar for the country but not necessarily a benefit for the airline itself. So there’s a multiplier of roughly eight to 10 times in terms of spend to the country. The issue for the government, at some point, will be to ask that question. So the government has to decide lah.Yes, ultimately it’s a question that the government has to decide because that affects the commitment of Khazanah towards the airline itself. If we only take one thing away from this interview, what should it be?Essentially, if we execute the [new] strategy correctly, then Khazanah really will become that guardian of the nation’s wealth and would be the guardian in terms of that future growth. And that’s important because I think what the country needs is basically a pool of assets that is focused on long-term growth, because over time, you need that pool of assets to contribute back to the national budget in a way that will help to relieve the pressure on other sources of income.Otherwise the country as a whole, our national budget, is overly dependent on just a few sources of income. You pointed out the Singapore example and that’s correct, you should have more diversification [on the sources of income] on the national budget. How long before Khazanah can play that role?The way I look at the portfolio today, it’s easily about seven to 10 years to fully restructure. But this has always been a long-term goal. Most sovereign wealth funds think about 30 years as their time horizon, and that’s why, like I said, what is the right balance or trade-off between short-term cash requirements versus a long-term generation of growth. I think that’s something that needs to be balanced.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-man-mandate,"2019-05-01 20:06:17"

(Feb 27, RM2.96)
Maintain trading buy with a target price (TP) of RM3.60: Telekom Malaysia (TM) reported a net profit of RM69.7 million in fourth quarter financial year 2018 (4QFY18), recovering from a loss of RM175.6 million in 3QFY18 that was mainly due to an impairment loss relating to its wireless and fixed network assets.For the current quarter, there was an additional impairment of RM48 million. Stripping out this and other non-operating items, normalised 4QFY18 net profit fell 53% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM104.9 million following the implementation of the mandatory standard of access pricing (MSAP).For full-year FY18, normalised net profit of RM632.4 million (-26.7% y-o-y) was within our expectation but slightly above market estimates of RM598.5 million.Our FY19 to FY20 forecast earnings estimates are increased marginally by 1% to 2% due to housekeeping changes. TM declared a two sen cash dividend, which works out to be about 50% of normalised net profit, in line with the management’s guidance of 40% to 60%.The group’s FY18 revenue was down 3.5% y-o-y due to lower contribution from data, Internet and multimedia as well as non-telecommunication-related services. Data revenue fell 7.1% y-o-y to RM664 million due to the implementation of MSAP while other revenue dropped 7.9% y-o-y to RM614 million on lower property contribution and lower tuition fees. Average revenue per user for unifi was lower at RM184 compared with RM197 in 4QFY17. Meanwhile, the subscriber base increased 15.3% y-o-y to 1,298,000.Also, the normalised net profit dropped 53% y-o-y due to the impact of MSAP on wholesale pricing, of which TM has recognised a provision of RM36.8 million (FY18: RM169.2 million).As for provision on impairment of fixed and wireless network assets, an additional sum of RM48 million was recognised in the current quarter (FY18: RM982.5 million). Note that these provisions have narrowed in 4QFY18.For 2019, we believe there will be no further pressure on broadband pricing as the communications and multimedia ministry has indicated its satisfaction of the price cut that took place in 2018. Therefore, we expect TM’s wholesale income to stabilise in FY19F, following the sharp decline in FY18.TM intends to dispose of two office towers (20-storey and 33-storey) that have a combined gross floor area of 679,015 sq ft in Pantai Baru, Kuala Lumpur.Assuming a selling consideration of RM1,100 per sq ft (psf) to RM1,200 psf, which is based on the market value of commercial properties in the surrounding areas, the sale of these towers could potentially raise RM747 million to RM815 million for the group.Based on our estimate, this would help reduce its gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation from 2.4 times to 2.2 times.Nevertheless, given the oversupply condition in Kuala Lumpur’s property market, we opine that it will be a challenge for TM to dispose of these properties at market value. We note that the 20-storey tower was purchased in 2005 at RM65.8 million. — PublicInvest Research, Feb 27",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/intended-sale-two-office-towers-seen-cut-down-tms-debt,"2019-05-01 20:06:18"

They want better services, with lower prices,” acting group chief executive officer Imri Mokhtar told reporters at the group’s FY18 results briefing yesterday.“So TM needs to go beyond just providing connectivity; we need to bring solutions, enabling more digital businesses. To do that, our investment will continue, and invest into digital infrastructure, not just network infrastructure,” he added.Imri said TM’s capital expenditure for FY19 will be 18% to 20% of the group’s total revenue, and will have a balanced investment into enhancing connectivity and digital infrastructure.“In the short term, for us, is to continue our investment while managing our cost, so we can still invest despite many challenges,” he said, adding that TM’s cost optimisation initiatives are expected to increase earnings before interest and tax (Ebit).“Most of the cost savings will be coming from our business operations, across all segments, be it Unifi or TM One, as we simplify business processes. The operation will become leaner,” he said.Therefore, Imri said TM expects Ebit in FY19 to be higher, but declined to provide guidance on the expected quantum of improvement. TM’s Ebit for FY18 fell 94.1% to RM64.6 million, from RM1.09 billion in FY17. 4Q profit slumps 75% as the group ‘took a big hit’ in 2018The group’s net profit for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (4QFY18) slumped 74.9% to RM69.66 million from RM277.01 million a year ago, as higher finance cost and lower foreign exchange gain on the group’s borrowings, besides higher tax charges, impact earnings.Revenue was also lower by 3.5% at RM3.09 billion, versus RM3.2 billion in 4QFY17.TM group chief financial officer Nor Fadhilah Mohd Ali said out of the group’s RM8.57 billion borrowings as at 4QFY18, 18% or RM1.54 billion of them were US dollar-denominated.He said the group hedged RM200 million of these US dollar-denominated borrowings, while the remaining were under natural hedge against TM’s US dollar revenue.For the full FY18, TM’s net profit dropped 83.5% to RM153.15 million from RM929.75 million a year ago, while revenue declined 2.2% to RM11.82 billion from RM12.09 billion.Imri, who is also TM chief operating officer, said 2018 was one of the most challenging times the group had ever faced, and that it “took a big hit” that year.Last year was the start of the implementation of the Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP), which resulted in lower wholesale network pricing. This allowed Internet service providers in the industry to lower their retail pricing to compete for higher market share.Nevertheless, Imri said the impact of the MSAP’s implementation has been cushioned somewhat by increasing Unifi subscription, as TM also lowered its Unifi entry prices and increase Internet speed in its retail offerings to keep up with the competition.“Also do remember that TM is not just [serving] broadband from home and SME (small and medium enterprises) customers, we [also] serve other customer segments too. Through TM One, we serve enterprise and public sector customers, and [through] TM Global [we serve] domestic and international telcos,” he said.In 4QFY18, TM’s fixed broadband customer base declined 4.2% to 2.23 million customers from 2.33 million customers a year ago, as the increase in Unifi subscribers was not sufficient to offset the amount of customers it lost in other broadband services.The average revenue per user (Arpu) for Unifi also fell 6.6% to RM184 in 4QFY18, from RM197 in the year-ago quarter, while Arpu for other broadband services declined 2.2% to RM88 from RM90.An analyst told The Edge Financial Daily that TM is expected to face the full impact from MSAP in stages.“This [quarter] is not the full impact yet, because there is limited amount of upgrade TM can do for its customers every month, and there is still a substantial amount of people who have not upgraded their package,” he said over the phone.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tm-issues-revenue-warning-fy19,"2019-05-01 20:06:23"

The onus is on the management and board to come back to the shareholders and say, ‘Look, we think this is going to be a more viable strategy going forward,’ then we will look at it and see whether we agree or not.”Shahril noted that Malaysia Airlines’ management is in the midst of reviewing its strategic plan and will provide the feedback to Khazanah “hopefully in a very short period of time”.The national sovereign fund, which took Malaysia Airlines private in 2014, has injected RM6 billion into the business in an effort to revive the national carrier.Last September, Malaysia Airlines told The Edge Malaysia weekly that more than half of the RM6 billion funds for its turnaround attempt had been used.The company blamed the weak ringgit and rising jet fuel costs that had derailed its turnover plan, causing it to miss two profitability deadlines since the initial plan was set to make money by 2017.More than RM1 billion dividend from Khazanah in 2019Shahril commented that Khazanah would declare more than RM1 billion of dividend to the government in 2019, adding that its commitment to delivering steady dividends to the nation’s coffer remains intact.“If you look at the budget, they [the government] assumed roughly RM1 billion plus [from Khazanah],” said Shahril.At over RM1 billion, it would be around the same as what Khazanah declared for the government in 2017, when Khazanah announced that the value of its investments climbed for the first time in three years, hitting an all-time high of RM115.6 billion, boosted by surging stock prices at home and abroad.In December last year, Khazanah divested a 16% stake or 1.4 billion shares in IHH Healthcare Bhd to Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM8.42 billion or RM6 a share, citing the divestment formed an important part of the restructuring of its portfolio, and the proceeds raised would be utilised for new investments and capital requirements.Besides IHH Healthcare, Khazanah’s core investments in the listed companies include CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd and UEM Sunrise Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, UEM Edgenta Bhd and Time dotCom Bhd.For more details on what Shahril has said on plans that are in store for Khazanah and companies in its portfolio, pick up the latest issue of The Edge Malaysia weekly.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysia-airlines-needs-good-proposal-more-funding,"2019-05-01 20:06:32"

His current tenure as TNB chairman will come to an end next month.It is interesting that the new Pakatan Harapan government is retaining Moggie as TNB chairman, given the wave of changes seen in the leadership of some government-linked companies following the 14th general election (GE14). Some prominent figures who have either resigned or been removed from their positions include Telekom Malaysia Bhd’s Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly and Tan Sri Habibul Rahman, who was on the board of Malaysia Airlines.Last year, TNB also saw two of its directors — Datuk Abdul Manad Hashim and Datuk Sakthivel Alagappan — choosing not to seek re-election during the group’s annual general meeting as the two felt they might be seen as politically linked.Moggie, 77, himself is keeping mum over his extension. He declined to comment when asked about the matter during TNB’s Chinese New Year celebration last Thursday.Prior to his appointment as TNB chairman, Moggie was an elected member of parliament for Kanowit between 1974 and 2004. Among some of the positions he has held include: energy, communications and multimedia minister (1998 to 2004), works minister (1989 to 1995), and energy, telecommunications and posts minister (1978 to 1989 and 1995 to 1998).He first rose to prominence during Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s first 22-year stint as the country’s prime minister in the 1980s. Last July, Dr Mahathir attended Moggie’s grandchild’s wedding in Sarawak during his first official visit to the state following his return to power as the country’s seventh prime minister.Khazanah Nasional Bhd is the largest shareholder of TNB with a 28.8% stake, followed by the Employees Provident Fund with 13.2%, according to Bloomberg data.In return to queries from The Edge Financial Daily, a spokesman for MoF Inc said there is no statement regarding Moggie’s extension as at press time. An officer at the Prime Minister’s Office also said they are not aware of the matter. Khazanah, when contacted, declined to comment. TNB, meanwhile, said they are unaware of the chairman’s future and that any announcements pertaining to that will be filed with Bursa Malaysia.It is worth noting that TNB’s share price was trading at RM16.06 prior to GE14 but has since fallen by 18.8% to close at RM13.04 last Friday.

365,"February 11, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TM,"EPF dividend of 5% possible, 6% may be difficult","THE Employees Provident Fund (EPF) is set to declare its annual dividend for 2018 anytime now and anyone who has been paying any attention would know that the odds of it outperforming that in 2017 are low.Not only was last year’s EPF dividend the highest payout in 21 years, nearly every major asset class globally — from stocks and bonds to crude oil and bitcoin — had little or negative returns for 2018. Even so-called havens such as gold and US Treasuries did not do that great year on year.Blaming the US Federal Reserve’s accelerated monetary policy tightening, some fund managers have reportedly lamented how the broad pullback was worse than the rout in 2008 and a stark contrast to the rally in 2017.In 2018, the MSCI World Index was down 8.2% (+23.07% in 2017), the MSCI World High Dividend Yield Index was down 6.7% (+19.17% in 2017), the MSCI Emerging Markets Index tumbled 14.3% (+37.75% in 2017) and the MSCI ACWI — which includes developed and emerging market countries such as China, India, Korea, Brazil and Russia — lost 8.93% after gaining 24.62% the year before.Malaysian equities were not spared. The bellwether FBM KLCI closed 2018 nearly 6% lower while the broader FBM Emas skidded close to 11% last year.Yet, some have seen it fit to blame the EPF’s likely lower year-on-year dividend rate for 2018 on local politics, not unlike how there were curious claims of a correlation between who the incumbent prime minister was and the high EPF dividends in 2017.Let’s set politics aside and take a more objective look at the investment numbers that the EPF has announced so far to see if its dividend rate for 2018 will be close to 5% or 6%.
 The EPF’s past showingFor the record, the EPF’s 6.9% dividend for 2017 was the highest since the 7.7% dividend declared for 1996, the year before the Asian financial crisis. The 6.4% maiden dividend declared for its Simpanan Shariah portfolio for 2017 was also 2.61% above the inflation rate of 3.79% last year.The EPF, which needs to generate consistent and sustainable returns to preserve its 14 million members’ retirement kitty, only needs to deliver at least 2.5% nominal dividend and beat inflation by at least 2% on a rolling three-year basis.The EPF’s fund size is also a growing challenge. Members’ savings have grown an average of 10.98% a year since 1990 to reach RM768.51 billion as at end-2017 (RM700.75 billion conventional and RM67.76 billion under Simpanan Shariah). As at end-September last year, accumulated contributions reached RM785.59 billion for its 14.1 million member base, of which 7.2 million were active (contributing).Between 2007 and 2017, dividends declared by the EPF had been trending upwards except for 2008, 2015 and 2016, the years when the local stock market fell.In 2008, the year the FBM KLCI fell a whopping 38.9%, the EPF’s dividend saw the largest year-on-year decline of 130 basis points from 5.8% in 2007 to 4.5% in 2008.Nonetheless, it is worth noting that one of the largest year-on-year gains in the provident fund’s dividend rate — a 115-basis-point jump — was recorded in 2009 (5.65% dividend rate) while 2017 saw a 120-basis-point jump to 6.9% from 5.7% in 2016.
 Growing burden of every 1% dividendTo pay 2017’s dividend last year, the EPF needed a total of RM48.13 billion, or RM7.02 billion to pay every 1% dividend for its conventional and shariah-compliant portfolios. The 2018 dividend for Simpanan Shariah would only be its second, having paid a total of RM3.98 billion or a 6.4% rate last year.For the conventional portion alone, the EPF needed RM44.15 billion, or RM6.4 billion for every 1% of the 6.9% dividend rate last year. The amount that it needs to pay 1% of dividend has grown at a 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.26% — the EPF needed only RM2.89 billion to pay 1% of dividend in 2007.That means the EPF could need at least RM7 billion to pay 1% of dividend for its conventional portfolio this year — that’s not counting the additional money it needs to pay returns for members with the shariah portfolio. The shariah portion would change the 10-year CAGR to 9.27% and bring the amount needed to cover 1% of dividend closer to RM7.7 billion, back-of-the-envelope calculations show.Put another way, the EPF will likely need to have RM35 billion to RM40 billion to pay a 5% dividend for 2018.For a 6% dividend, the EPF would probably need to have made RM42 billion to RM46 billion last year — which means a 6% dividend for 2018 is a tall order in a tough year. Even if the figure is likely lower year on year, the returns are still no small feat for a fund like the EPF, which cannot take on too much risk due to the need to preserve capital.
 Did it make enough for a 6% dividend?For 2017, the EPF’s gross investment income stood at RM48.54 billion (conventional) and RM4.6 billion (shariah), which adds up to RM53.14 billion.According to the EPF’s unaudited figures for the first nine months of 2018, its quarterly investment income was higher year on year, with investment income at RM12.88 billion (1Q2018), RM12.39 billion (2Q2018) and RM14.61 billion (3Q2018), bringing the unaudited total to just under RM40 billion, which may well be subject to adjustments and write-downs, if any, in the final quarter.That means a 5% dividend should be possible, even if the fourth-quarter income is a lot smaller. The wild card, of course, is the impact of potential write-downs.Fourth-quarter figures had not been released at press time and may only be out in April when its annual report is released but the dividend rate is likely to be declared anytime this month. Ten of its past 13 annual dividend announcements have been in February, with the exceptions being in 2008 and 2009 when the rate was announced by mid-March. For 2007, the dividend rate was announced on Jan 31, 2008.The EPF has yet to release its top 30 equity holdings in Malaysia as at end-2018, with data on its website being that of end-September 2018, at the time of writing.Based on the 35 stocks that were on its top 30 holdings the past four quarters and its shareholding level from stock exchange filings as at end-2018, however, the value of these 35 EPF holdings would have fallen by roughly RM7.5 billion as at end-2018 versus end-2017 — if one were to make a simplistic assumption that its shareholding a year ago was the same as end-2018.The largest declines were from Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Sime Darby Plantations Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd, Digi.com Bhd and Maxis Bhd while the largest gains were seen at Public Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, PPB Group Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd. But the estimated RM11.8 billion decline in market value versus RM4.2 billion estimated gains in market value are a mere guesstimate, at best, and may not mean there will be sizeable equity write-downs.It is worth noting that the EPF has been building a steady income stream, likely with the desire to at least meet its annual minimum dividend payout requirement, come what may.In 2017, dividends on investments came to RM10.33 billion, being 19.4% of total gross investment income. The steady stream of interest and profits it has from its investments gave it another RM13.93 billion in 2017, or 26.22% of gross investment income. In other words, these two income streams alone were enough to pay about 3.4% or nearly half of the EPF’s dividend payout last year.So while EPF chairman Tan Sri Samsudin Osman did not give away much on Jan 15 when asked about the potential dividend payout for 2018, it is clear that the tough market conditions last year has put the fund’s defensive strategy to the test. Should its defensive strategy bear fruit, the stage is set for it to take a pat on the back. If it has been found wanting, a clear direction would be necessary to show that the EPF can rebound stronger than ever this year.

366,"February 11, 2019 09:06 am +08",TM,"Thinning spread between telco yields and FD rates","KUALA LUMPUR: Gone are the days that telecommunications (telco) stocks on Bursa Malaysia were top picks for dividend play investors, but as competition remains — coupled with underlying regulatory risks — analysts are worried that the dividend yields of these securities will drop below the country’s fixed deposit (FD) rates.The dividend yield of Axiata Group Bhd — one of the Big Three mobile network operators (MNOs) — has dipped below FD rates since early 2017, after the group decided to lower dividend payouts to conserve ammunition for capital expenditure and to face potentially more intense competition and foreign exchange volatility.Bank Negara Malaysia’s monthly statistics show that apart from January last year, when the average three-month FD rate was lower at 3.01%, rates averaged between 3.15% and 3.17% up until November.JF Apex Securities Bhd analyst Siau Li Shen pointed out that the dividend yields of other telco stocks, while not lower than FD rates, have been hovering only marginally above the commercial banks’ less risky option.“The telco sector is still underweight; there are concerns about regulatory risks, as well as existing competition. Currently, there are no significant rerating catalysts. So if everything remains the same throughout the whole of 2019, we are expecting a flattish performance.“Yields from telcos like Maxis Bhd were between 3.5% and 4% last year, so [the] dividend yield is not as attractive as [in] the past; [it’s] just slightly above the FD rate,” he told The Edge Financial Daily when contacted.According to Bloomberg data, apart from Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), which registered an unusually high dividend yield last year due to its share price weakness, DiGi.Com Bhd had the highest yield — though just above 4% — among the three MNOs.DiGi announced a final dividend per share of 4.8 sen or RM373 million last month (January) along with the release of the group’s earnings for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (4QFY18). This brings its full FY18 dividend payout to 19.6 sen, versus 18.8 sen for FY17.Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Tan J Young shared the view that telcos’ current yields are nothing enticing. “With the expectation that the OPR (Overnight Policy Rate) will stay at 3.25%, telcos’ yields are not attractive enough to spur buying interest,” he said. Despite lowest yield, Axiata has most ‘buys’Interestingly, although Axiata had the lowest dividend yield of 2.12% among its peers, the stock garnered the most “buy” calls from the research fraternity, according to Bloomberg data.BIMB Securities Research analyst Mohamad Khairul Fahmi, who also placed it on “buy” with a target price of RM4.60, said this was attributable to Axiata’s regional exposure.“Axiata has exposure to other countries, unlike Maxis and DiGi.Com [whose] operations are confined to Malaysia, and locally there is norerating catalyst,” he said.JF Apex’s Siau also pointed to concerns about Maxis’ margin after the termination of the 3G Radio Access Network (RAN) share agreement with U Mobile Sdn Bhd.“Their (Maxis) margin may be lower without the 3G RAN share revenue. Although it is extended until the middle of this year, the scope is limited. Overall, [investing in the] telco industry is not very convincing this year,” he said.Last December, U Mobile and Maxis announced that they had entered into an extension of the agreement in limited areas until end-June 2019. The termination was originally supposed to end on Dec 27, 2018.In May 2017, U Mobile chief executive officer Wong Heang Tuck told The Edge Malaysia weekly in an interview that the company paid RM200 million to RM300 million for the RAN sharing service in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2015 (FY15).Nonetheless, BIMB’s Mohamad Khairul thinks that Maxis — like DiGi — is likely to report marginal growth for its FY18 performance and within consensus estimate, while flattening out in FY19.DiGi reported a 5% net profit growth to RM377.8 million for 4QFY18, from RM360.08 million a year ago, as revenue grew 2% to RM1.67 billion from RM1.64 billion. This led to a 4% growth in the group’s full FY18 net profit to RM1.54 billion from RM1.48 billion for FY17, while revenue grew 3% to RM6.53 billion from RM6.34 billion.Mohamad Khairul said MNOs’ performance in 2019 will very much hinge on the innovation in product offerings.“How they are going to perform this year is highly dependent on how innovative they are in their offerings to entice subscribers. The more value they offer, the more subscribers they could acquire,” he said.Mohamad Khairul said increasing Internet consumption on mobile devices is driving Malaysians to move to products offering features relevant to such trends.“For example, U Mobile recently offered their unlimited Internet plan for their prepaid segment, which would stir up some competition. With the SIM migration trend from prepaid to post-paid, telcos are also competing through device-bundled offerings.“People now are more willing to take up higher-value packages because Internet consumption is getting higher compared to few years ago. The same mobile application today is using more data compared to the past,” he added.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/thinning-spread-between-telco-yields-and-fd-rates,"2019-05-01 20:06:35"

However, we note that Astro has managed to slowdown the subscriber loss with NJOI,” it said.Should the ban materialise, HLIB said Astro would be a beneficiary as this could possibly put a halt to — or at least slow down — its declining premium subscriber base and lift its average revenue per user, which is currently at RM99.90.However, ban or no ban, Astro would still face competition from legal streaming platforms like Netflix.In the meantime, another piece of good news for Astro would be Telekom Malaysia Bhd’s (TM’s) announcement that their latest Unifi package would not be bundled with Unifi TV subscription, due to changing consumer trends.“We view the news as a positive for Astro, as this could assist Astro to expand their subscriber base. Astro controlled 77% market share of Pay-TV market in Malaysia and the rest is controlled by TM through Unifi TV,” HLIB said.But following the recent surge in Astro share price, HLIB has downgraded Astro from “buy” to “hold”, with an unchanged target price of RM1.70. HLIB is also keeping the media sector on “underweight”.“Nevertheless, Astro’s earnings prospect remain intact on the back of its stable advertising expenditure outlook and coupled with generous dividend payment of 5% yield,” it added.Astro shares settled unchanged at RM1.66 yesterday after 1.36 million shares were done, with a market capitalisation of RM8.76 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/proposed-clampdown-android-tv-box-would-boost-astro,"2019-05-01 20:06:35"
368,"February 07, 2019 11:30 am +08",TM,"Government in business needs smart partnerships","In his Budget 2019 speech, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng declared that “the business of the government is not to be in business ... and the government will focus its expenditure and investments only in strategic sectors and areas where free markets and the private sector are not interested or unable to meet the needs of the people and the economy”.Academician Terence Gomez of Universiti Malaya estimated that, as of 2017, government-linked companies (GLCs) owned by the government-linked investment companies (GLICs) constituted 42% of the total market capitalisation of all public-listed firms in Malaysia. At the Malaysia: A New Dawn forum last October, Lim’s political secretary Tony Pua said that divestment of some non-core GLC assets would raise much-needed funds and encourage greater participation of the private sector.How will the government decide which enterprises should be the target of its investment or divestment, and why? The Pakatan Harapan government has a unique opportunity to conduct a fundamental and strategic rethink of the role of the state in business, beyond immediate fundraising and addressing “crowding-out” concerns. At present, the government is missing a public overarching “ownership policy” that discloses when, why and how the government may impose public policy objectives on GLCs and GLICs.One common justification in the 1980s and early 1990s was that the private sector would not otherwise invest in these crucial businesses. This “market-failure” rationale is uncontroversial and often relied on by governments to justify control or ownership of assets and businesses. It was a particularly populist rationale when combined with the bumiputera empowerment agenda as a major social justification for investments.The government implemented this objective through government-linked investment companies such as Khazanah Nasional Bhd and Permodalan Nasional Bhd or by investing in GLCs such as Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and UEM Group Bhd. As capital markets were then relatively underdeveloped, government assistance to start Perwaja Holdings Bhd, Heavy Industries Corp of Malaysia Bhd (Hicom) and Proton Holdings Bhd was thought necessary. Alternatively, it was said that a “big push” by the state was needed to catalyse coordinated upstream and downstream development of certain industry ecosystems, leading to investment in companies such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, a wafer fab and semiconductor manufacturer.Another rationale was that public goods or natural monopoly cost structures required government investment as shareholders in companies involved in these sectors. Unlike companies, whether public or private, the GLCs have to answer to a wider group of stakeholders, beyond the shareholders and investors. The government, as a major or strategic shareholder in the GLCs, has a broader political or social agenda beyond maximising profits.The public, as consumers of the products or services of the GLCs, especially those in utilities or infrastructure, do not favour any increases in tariffs, however well justified. The unions and employees may not necessarily be sympathetic to any restructurings to enhance shareholder value if these steps will result in job losses.The government will have to manage these conflicting objectives and priorities. Nevertheless, as technology disrupts long-standing industry practices, caution should be taken against using this justification to protect an entire industry value chain on this. For example, in Malaysia, electricity transmission may continue to be a natural monopoly but not electricity generation, with the advent of independent power producers with substantial private sector investments.The concept of “strategic sectors” is more controversial. Practically every government investment has been called “strategic” at least once before! What makes an investment truly so? Most state investments were and continue to be justified on the ground that they are critical to serve as a catalyst for industry development or economic growth. Examples include Boustead Holdings Bhd in defence and Telekom Malaysia in telecommunications — major GLCs whose dominance in the industries are often justified on national security or geopolitical reasons. This rationale should not be too quickly dismissed as outdated or even socialist.The Washington Consensus prescribing wholesale deregulation and privatisation has collapsed. The rise of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), particularly China, has provided a tempting, alternative, state-driven developmental model. On the other hand, the UEM Group was acquired as a GLC in the wake of the 1998 Asian financial crisis, the rationale being that its potential collapse posed systemic risks to the banking sector and capital markets. Nevertheless, the fact that the acquisitions were strategic then does not necessarily mean that the government should continue to own a substantial stake in them.We have two concerns on the dominance of government in business. First, government ownership or control of strategic businesses or assets must avoid any unintended “crowding out” or undermining of our robust and successful private sector. The previous approach of opaquely selecting individuals as “national champions” has been criticised as an example of cronyism and state capture. Indeed, “picking winners” has, ironically, often left us with losers requiring subsequent government bailout such as Perwaja Steel and Malaysian Airline System Bhd.If the government’s approach is to target entire “strategic sectors” as suggested by the finance minister, it can facilitate competition by backing not one, but multiple, competing firms. For all the criticisms of the national car project, it was courageous of the government to pit two competitors, Proton and Perodua, against each other. If this competitive approach can be adopted in the automobile industry with its high-capital intensity and strong economies of scale, why not emulate it in other industry sectors?An alternative approach is to ensure that where the government undertakes business activities in competition with the private sector, they do so on a fair and equitable basis. In 2000, the state government of Victoria, in adopting a competitive neutrality policy, defined it as “the elimination of resource allocation distortions arising out of the public ownership of entities engaged in significant business activities”. In short, government business should not enjoy any net competitive advantage simply as a result of its public sector ownership.Second, substantial funds are usually required for the government to exercise control or influence over a GLC. The traditional majority ownership stake gives the government both ongoing control and a share in the upside of the business. With respect, we believe it is neither necessary nor important for the government to always own or have majority control of every enterprise that it invests in. It is possible to structure alternative mechanisms for the government to achieve this objective without necessarily having to own a substantial stake. Where both control and share of profits is not needed, the government can provide finance by way of debt through the many state-owned development banks.This is applicable to small and medium enterprises and projects in conventional, relatively low-risk industries. Where a share of profits is needed but not full control, the government could take a minority stake or legal devices like royalty rights over intellectual property. For high-technology or start-up investments, this “light-touch” portfolio approach to investment is more appropriate. Where control is needed but a share of profits is not, there is always the time-hallowed but heavy-handed golden share. But, its use should be limited to truly strategic enterprises as they bear the risk of abuse without direct financial returns to the state.Where the government needs to maintain majority shareholdings, there is all the more reason to ensure good governance of GLICs and GLCs. While GLC governance has improved since the completion of the GLC Transformation Programme in 2015, the recent controversies at Lembaga Tabung Haji indicate that there is room for improvement. Beyond the recent specific reforms for TH, broader reforms across all GLCs and GLICs are needed. Transparency and disclosure of specific data on GLIC investment performance as well as on the appointment criteria and remuneration of directors at GLCs and GLICs can be improved. To this end, the government can resuscitate the idea of a State-Owned Enterprise and Government-Linked Companies Act.Moving forward, we suggest the government should recalibrate its focus from sectors to technologies. Given Malaysia’s so-called “middle-income trap”, the government should invest with the aim of fostering innovation. As the economist Mariana Mazzucato noted in her book, The Entrepreneurial State, innovation is highly uncertain, collective and cumulative, and has long lead times. Hence, the need for “patient” capital by the state, as opposed to private venture-capital funding, which can be excessively focused on short-term exits.Even radical inventions like the smartphone have been traced back ultimately to research funded by the US government. If the state promotes “general-purpose” technologies such as artificial intelligence and renewable energy, private sector investment can be “crowded-in” by the spawning of entirely new markets for products and services. One would not describe most GLCs as paragons of such innovation.In Malaysia, we already have state-owned venture capital funds such as Malaysia Technology Development Corp, Malaysia Debt Ventures Bhd and Cradle Fund Sdn Bhd. The streamlining of these funds as well as the RM2 billion matching grants announced in Budget 2019, while laudable, do not go far enough. The sums they have invested so far are miniscule compared to that by the GLICs. This may be understandable given these VC funds’ mandates to support early-stage or seed financing. Whereas GLICs like the Employees’ Provident Fund, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan Diperbadankan and Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera need reliable cash cows, not uncertain start-up moonshots, to consistently deliver annual dividends.We believe choosing between profitability and innovation is not a zero-sum game. To raise funds for investments in innovative companies, GLICs can divest stakes in certain asset-rich GLCs that have persistent losses or low profitability, no business synergies with other GLCs and insignificant strategic or social value. These will contribute little to GLICs’ cash flows in any case, even in the long term. For example, the Rangkaian Hotel Seri Malaysia Sdn Bhd is owned by no less than Minister of Finance Inc (MoF Inc) and operates 19 hotels throughout Malaysia but has suffered occupancy, branding and management challenges over the past decade.Neither do we advocate a 360° change in GLIC risk appetites and investment strategy. Some of the funds raised from divestments of unprofitable investments can be channelled into risky early-stage financing via state-owned VC funds, with the balance to be retained by the GLICs for safer late-stage investments in more mature companies.Khazanah and MoF Inc, the more “strategically-oriented” among the seven GLICs, would be most suited for this mission. Khazanah has already invested in successful tech firms such as Phunware Inc in 2009 and Garena and Blippar in 2016. However, as reported by New Straits Times on Jan 11, 2019, Khazanah’s current investment in innovation and technology companies stands at only 4% of its total portfolio. If carefully managed, a gradual shift in GLIC portfolios further towards more mature tech investments need not significantly affect GLICs’ risk profile.Malaysian GLICs and GLICs are currently, at best, maintaining a comfortable existence. But, if well-focused, well-governed and well-regulated, they can have tremendous potential in unlocking creative destruction or disruption in businesses without crowding out the private sector. This smart partnership between the public and private sectors can propel Malaysia to the next stage of economic growth.Chew Seng Kok is the managing director of ZICO Holdings Inc, a company listed on the Singapore Exchange’s Catalist board.

370,"February 05, 2019 17:00 pm +08",TM,"Mesiniaga’s big break ? ","THERE was frenzied buying of Mesiniaga Bhd shares following news that the company had secured a contract worth RM1.9 billion to manage a submarine cable that will be built to connect Hong Kong and Malaysia.The stock hit RM1.75 last Wednesday — the highest level since August 2014. For the week, it soared 54 sen or 46.55% to RM1.70 after the award of the Enhancing Malaysia International Internet Gateway (EM-IIG) contract was announced.Mesiniaga tells The Edge that the contract is for the supply and implementation of core, aggregation and access network equipment as well as its support system.“The equipment will be used to connect the main network with the international gateway and provide internet service to the Malaysian public,” it says.However, in an unexpected twist, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail later issued a statement saying that the government did not commit to anything relating to EM-IIG, which is undertaken by a private company, Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn Bhd. The firm is controlled by executive chairman Datuk Seri Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahim, who is the brother of former Lembaga Tabung Haji chairman Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim.This has raised concerns over the viability of the project.Xiddig, a little-known company, has welcomed the publicity. “It’s a blessing in disguise,” says Abdul Rashid. “[The recent news] gives a good message to the country that we are coming, we are ready.”The EM-IIG is a high-speed broadband project boasting 7,500km of the “world’s fastest” 150TB undersea cable connecting Hong Kong and Malaysia, and 110,000km of land cables plus five cable landing stations nationwide, which will cost a whopping RM5.4 billion in total.The project, which was first reported in 2017, is solely owned by Xiddig — which, until recently, was mainly involved in the provision of mobile virtual network services.Sole ownership of undersea cable projects is uncommon. Even the likes of Telekom Malaysia Bhd — which has a couple of such projects — has worked with others as a consortium to undertake such mammoth tasks.Others, like TIME dotCom Bhd, hold strategic stakes in international submarine cable systems while owning their own cable landing stations.What really caught public attention in the case of Xiddig, however, was what transpired at the official launch of the project last week.At the event, former Penang deputy chief minister Datuk Rashid Hasnon was reported to have read out a speech to officiate the event — meant to be delivered by Wan Azizah — which underlined the government’s commitment to the project.To that, Abdul Rashid remarked that the issue is being politicised.According to him, based on official communications, key members of the government, including Wan Azizah and Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo, were “very supportive” of the venture previously.Others, like Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng, are also aware of the project as Xiddig has been holding roadshows on the project in all states over the past few years, he says.“We gave a presentation to the MCMC (Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission),” Abdul Rashid says, adding that it was very helpful and granted Xiddig a submarine cable landing licence.“None of us are politicians ... we are 100% business people.”He says EM-IIG is fully private sector-driven, the necessary funding has been secured and it has found reputable partners to execute the project.Xiddig, according to Abdul Rashid, has entered into contracts with integrated turnkey submarine network solutions provider Alcatel Submarine Networks for the provision and laying of the undersea cables. Work is expected to start in three months’ time.US-based CommScope Inc will provide the land cables while Mesiniaga will manage the system when it comes onstream before the end of the year.On Mesiniaga, Abdul Rashid says the company was chosen partly because of its track record as a vendor for other telecommunications companies. “Other bids in the open tenders, including by several overseas players, were too expensive.”But with cash equivalents of RM31.05 million as at its latest quarter, does Mesiniaga have the capacity to take on the project?“Xiddig’s payments will be made progressively over 24 months, in accordance with the terms of the contract,” he says.Hence, comes the question of funding, considering the size of the project, the apparent tie-up with prominent names in the industry and Xiddig’s lack of a track record in carrying out such a huge venture.Abdul Rashid notes that Xiddig has already raised the funds for the entire project by selling preference shares in a special purpose vehicle, Xiddig Technology.Details, however, were not shared. “We have signed a non-disclosure agreement with [the funders],” he says.Meanwhile, Xiddig also needs to sort out other issues, such as getting the right of way to land for its land cable network and, more importantly, securing off-takers for the additional capacity from the project.The big plan is to provide fibre-to-the-home services under the Xiddig brand and sell the capacity to corporations and other telcos, says Abdul Rashid.None of this has materialised yet, but Xiddig says local telco tower owners have already inked letters of intent with it to buy data when the project comes onstream.“This is a revenue-generating project for the country. It can also improve the internet speed for Malaysians,” says Abdul Rashid. “Sometimes, we feel sad that the [issues that cropped up following the project launch] were blown out of proportion.” ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mesiniagas-big-break,"2019-05-01 20:06:37"

Former COO Shazril Imri Mokhtar was left to run the company as acting CEO.At present VADS is parked under TM One, which comes under the TM umbrella.The business process outsourcing outfit has several units, including VADS Business Process Sdn Bhd, PT VADS Indonesia, VADS Digital Sdn Bhd, VADS e-Services Sdn Bhd, VADS Professional Services Sdn Bhd and VADS Solutions Sdn Bhd.In the financial year ended December 2017 (FY2017), VADS registered an after tax profit of RM251.06 million on the back of RM594.23 million in revenue, a check on RAM Rating reveals. However, the profit figure for that year seems distorted as in FY2016, the company made a loss of RM26.24 million.In the three financial years prior to that, its earnings rose markedly, growing from RM5.29 million in FY2013 to RM39.76 million in FY2014 and doubling to RM79.57 million in FY2015.As at end-December 2017, VADS had RM374.81 million in current assets and RM169.89 million in non-current assets, while current liabilities amounted to RM254.45 million. It had no long-term debt commitments.Its parent, TM, ended trading last Friday at RM2.78. Over the past year TM has lost more than half of its value, the erosion came largely after the government announced that telcos would have to adhere to the mandatory standards on access pricing, which meant lower fixed broadband prices.For the nine months ended September 2018, TM registered a net profit of RM83.49 million on RM8.73 billion in revenue. In the third quarter, the state-owned telco suffered a net loss of RM175.59 million on RM2.95 billion revenue, largely a result of impairments of RM934.8 million.As at end-September 2018, TM had cash and bank balances of RM2.19 billion, and on the other side of the balance sheet it had long-term borrowings of RM7.55 billion and short-term debt obligations of RM1.34 billion. For the nine months, it forked out RM315.6 million in finance costs.VADS was previously public listed but in 2008, in an effort to boost its earnings, TM privatised its 63%-owned unit and delisted the company the following year.Its RM417.3 million offer, RM7.60 per share, was a 12% premium to VADS’ then closing price. However some analysts were of the view its fair value was closer to RM8.70 a share. The stock’s average fair value from six analysts compiled by Bloomberg was RM7.70.“The privatisation of VADS will accord the TM group greater flexibility to streamline its businesses to maximise potential synergies and cost-saving benefits,” TM said in a statement to Bursa Malaysia after the privatisation exercise. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/newsbreak-tm-may-be-selling-vads,"2019-05-01 20:06:38"
372,"January 17, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TM,"Cover Story: On the defensive","LAST week, the global equity rout picked up from where it left off in 2018 amid renewed concerns about slowing world economic growth and the repercussions of the ongoing US-China trade war.With most of the uncertainties faced in 2018 still unresolved, whether it was the trade tensions, global economic growth, the hiking of interest rates by the US Federal Reserve or Brexit, investor reaction has been to opt for less risky assets.Malaysian stocks were not spared the selldown as the FBM KLCI saw its worst first trading day of the year since 2016, tumbling 1.33% to close at 1,668.11 points last Wednesday. In the last decade, 2012 and 2016 were the only times the benchmark index fell more than 1% on the first trading day of the year.Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong, who believes much of the selldown was driven by negative investor sentiment, advises those who are tired of the volatile market to take a defensive stance for the time being.“Of course, investors who are weary of the negative sentiment affecting the market can deploy a temporary defensive strategy, pending a clearer picture on the economic front,” he says, adding that the fundamentals of some of the listed companies remained intact.According to Wong, some of these companies offer attractive dividend yields following the sharp decline in the market in the last one year. “Apart from dividend yields, investors could also benefit when the share prices of some of these companies recover,” he tells The Edge.Acknowledging that it is difficult to time the market, he says long-term investors with an investment horizon of three to five years could start accumulating stocks with strong fundamentals and sustainable business models.He believes that Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) is a good defensive stock for one’s portfolio. It is the largest company listed on Bursa Malaysia by market capitalisation and offers an attractive dividend yield of 6.1%.Wong opines that the recent selldown presents a great opportunity for investors to accumulate Maybank, which is a solid long-term play, given its dominance in the local banking sector.“If you look at Maybank, it is giving a good yield of 5% to 6%. While there might be a prolonged weakness in the stock market, it still gives a good entry point for investors who want to have exposure to one of the largest banks in the country. Compared with its high last year, the stock has fallen quite a bit. I think investors can benefit from the sustainable dividend payout as well as the upside potential in the event of a recovery in the stock market as a whole,” he says.Maybank has fallen about 8.8% from a recent high of RM10.262. Compared with 2017, the bank managed to eke out total returns of 1.4% last year. Nonetheless, it was not spared the selldown in 4Q2018 as it lost more than 4% of its value during the quarter.Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee also expects volatility to reign this year, emanating from the US as the Fed is expected to continue to raise its interest rates.“Such volatility is expected to cause ripples in the Asian markets. Overall, we believe investors are now more risk-averse and would prefer to accumulate on weakness in stocks with solid value propositions. As before, there are no outstanding sectors as we prefer to go bottom up,” he says.Another fund manager with a local asset management company tells The Edge that going for dividend plays, such as real estate investment trusts and consumer-related stocks, would be a good strategy while waiting for a clearer picture to emerge on the economic front. For example, both Pavilion REIT and IGB REIT offer decent yields of 5.4% and 5.3% respectively. They own popular malls such as the Pavilion Shopping Mall, and Mid Valley Megamall and The Gardens Mall respectively and posted higher rental income in their latest quarterly results.Beverage companies such as Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd and Nestlé (M) Bhd could also be good defensive plays. Both F&N and Nestlé were among the top performers last year, recording total returns of 28% and 47.4% respectively, despite the sharp decline in the overall equity market. Heineken and Carlsberg also performed well, recording total returns of 9% and 38.3% respectively in the same period, and offer decent yields of 3% to 4%. Click / Tap image to enlarge However, the fund manager notes that it is important for investors to look at companies that have a strong balance sheet and are able to maintain their dividend payouts as these could be trimmed if a global economic slowdown hits corporate incomes. He cites Uchi Technologies Bhd, Apollo Food Holdings Bhd, Classic Scenic Bhd and Asia File Corp Bhd as examples.According to Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) head of research Jeremy Goh, among the companies that are expected to offer attractive dividends is Taliworks Corp Bhd as the Selangor water consolidation exercise should be completed by the first half of this year. “Assuming the management follows the repayment schedule proposed by Pengurusan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd, the company could distribute a total dividend of 7.2 sen, which translates into 9.2% based on its closing price of 78.5 sen last Thursday,” Goh says.There is also the possibility of a lump sum upfront special dividend if the management chooses to monetise the receivables to third-party institutions.Goh adds that a stock selection strategy is required amid the uncertainties in the market. “I think we have to look at stock specifics in the current environment as opposed to broader-based sector allocation,” he explains, noting that one of the key sectors to benefit from Budget 2019 is healthcare.In November last year, the Pakatan Harapan government announced that the allocation for health services would be increased by about 7.8% to RM29 billion as it aimed to improve the quality of healthcare in the country. It also introduced the B40 National Health Protection Fund, available from Jan 1, on a partnership basis with private insurance companies.In the partnership, the government will pilot the fund to provide free protection against the top four critical illnesses of up to RM8,000 and up to 14 days of hospitalisation income cover at RM50 per day. Great Eastern Life Insurance was mentioned as one of the first insurance companies to agree to a RM2 billion contribution to the fund, which will be managed by Bank Negara Malaysia.Goh believes the B40 National Health Protection Fund will divert some of the patients from government hospitals to private hospitals, which, in turn, will benefit healthcare players.HLIB has highlighted UEM Edgenta Bhd as a beneficiary of potential higher work orders from the Ministry of Health. It has a 10-year concession for 32 hospitals in the northern region (ending 2025) and saw its healthcare segment account for 46% of its revenue and 41% of its profit before tax in the first nine months of its financial year ended Sept 30, 2018.An analyst who spoke to The Edge on condition of anonymity says selective export manufacturers could be a good bet with the ringgit hovering at a lower level than the average of 4.03 against the US dollar last year. The ringgit was trading at 4.14 against the greenback at the time of writing.“If you look at where the ringgit is today, the exporters are already benefiting by about 3% from foreign exchange alone. Of course, with concerns about a global economic slowdown, not all the exporters will benefit. The more resilient ones, such as the glove manufacturers, could be a good option,” he says.It is worth noting, however, that the US dollar’s strength could weaken this year with a slower pace of rate hikes by the Fed.While it is uncertain if the glove manufacturers will be able to maintain their strong growth momentum, they performed well last year, both in terms of share price and financial results on the back of capacity expansion in the last few years. Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Top Glove Corp Bhd, the top two glove manufacturers by market capitalisation, saw total returns of 19.9% and 42.7% respectively last year and also became FBM KLCI constituents. Traditional defensive plays down in 2018The traditional defensive playbook may not work in current conditions as the local market faces additional pressures from the change in government last May, the analyst says.He sees the struggles of traditional defensive counters, such as the utility and telecommunications players, as evidence of investors needing to be aware of regulatory and political risks as well. Telekom Malaysia Bhd, which offers a dividend yield of more than 4%, has fallen more than 50% in the last one year while Tenaga Nasional Bhd has lost about 7.1% in the same period.Recall that Minister of Communications and Multimedia Gobind Singh Deo pushed the telcos to double the internet speed in the country for half the price on his first day at work, triggering a selloff in the telecoms giant on concerns over the impact on its bottom line.Other blue-chip counters affected by policy change are the gaming counters, which were impacted by the higher taxes announced in Budget 2019. Genting Malaysia Bhd and Genting Bhd have fallen 44.4% and 35.7% respectively in the last one year. Similarly, despite the allure of high dividend yields among the number forecast operators (NFOs) such as Magnum Bhd and Berjaya Sports Toto, analysts remain sceptical about the sustainability of high payouts in the current environment. Both Magnum and BToto have a dividend yield of 8.2% and 7.5% respectively. Are REITs still defensive despite rising rates?While REITs are perceived to be defensive, they also compete with 10-year Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) that offer a yield of 4.07%. The Edge Financial Daily reported recently that the 18 REITs listed on Bursa produced an unexciting 1.88% yield spread over the 10-year MGS yield, which is a typical benchmark to compare returns from REITs.Be that as it may, REITs may still be an asset class for retail investors seeking defensive plays and have little access to MGS.One of the risks in this space is the rising interest rate environment. Further hikes could potentially lower the profitability of Malaysian REITs with higher finance costs and deferred acquisitions. Recall that Bank Negara raised its overnight policy rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 3.25% in January last year. So far, most economists are expecting the OPR to remain unchanged for the rest of the year.Nonetheless, Bloomberg data shows that most of the analysts have a “buy” or “hold” call on REITs following their decline last year. Among the 11 companies that are covered by analysts, the average return based on their target price is 7.7%.Three analysts have a “buy” call on Al-Aqar’ Healthcare REIT with the highest potential return of 23.4%. Most analysts have cited its unique position as a defensive healthcare REIT for their “buy” call.Only KLCCP Stapled Group and Axis REIT have a negative return based on the analysts’ target prices for the year.Maybank IB Research analyst Kevin Wong says in a 2018 strategy report that the growth of the REIT space this year could largely be organic via positive rental reversions and sustained occupancy rates as some of the REITs would record full-year rental income contributions from assets that were acquired or developed in 2018. These include Axis REIT, Pavilion REIT and YTL Hospitality REIT.“Due to an ongoing oversupply of retail and office space, particularly in the Klang Valley, we continue to favour prime malls in prominent locations such as Mid Valley Megamall, Pavilion, Suria KLCC and Sunway Pyramid and office assets with long-term tenants such as the Petronas Twin Towers and Menara Shell,” Wong says, adding that YTL Hospitality REIT is his top buy due to its resilient earnings from its Malaysian and Japanese assets, which are on master leases with rental step-ups.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-defensive,"2019-05-01 20:06:39"

Izzadin had been at the helm of UEM since July 2009.Mohd Izani, who will turn 50 this year, is currently executive director of investments and overseeing executive director of Khazanah’s regional office in Turkey.He joined Khazanah in March 2005, after stints with government-controlled Putrajaya Holdings Sdn Bhd and the Renong group. He was Khazanah’s chief financial officer for seven years before assuming the current role in June 2017.Mohd Izani currently sits on the board of Khazanah’s 33.21%-owned unit, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, as a non-independent non-executive director, chairman of the board’s nomination and remuneration committee and a member of the audit committee and the finance and investment committee. He is also a board member of MAHB’s wholly-owned Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen International Airport Investment Development and Operation Inc and LGM Airport Operations Trade and Tourism Inc.Apart from the above, he is also on the board of Bank Muamalat Bhd — an Islamic bank, in which Khazanah has 30% equity interest — and a director of Fajar Capital Ltd, Rantau Abang Capital Bhd, Feringghi Capital Ltd, Klebang Capital Ltd, Lido Capital Ltd and Cenang Capital Ltd, among others.Mohd Izani has a degree in political science from The London School of Economics and Political Science, the UK, and a Bachelor of Science (Economics), after which he pursued an accounting degree under the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and was admitted as a fellow in 1998. He is also a member of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants.His appointment is key as it comes at a time when the government is looking at restructuring or even hiving off some its assets.UEM is among the key holding companies for Khazanah. As at end-December 2017, UEM had total assets of RM26.83 billion, long-term borrowings of RM9.51 billion and short-term debt commitments amounting to RM5.31 billion.For the year ended December 2017, it posted an after-tax profit of RM742.9 million on revenue of RM7.05 billion. To put things in perspective, the group had RM6.9 billion in accumulated profits.Among the more prominent companies under UEM are 51%-owned highway operator PLUS Malaysia Bhd, publicly traded UEM Edgenta Bhd (68.15%), UEM Sunrise Bhd (66%) and Cement Industries of Malaysia Bhd as well as construction player UEM Builders Bhd.The remaining 49% stake in PLUS Malaysia is held by the Employees Provident Fund.There have been two proposals to take over PLUS Malaysia — by Tan Sri Abu Sahid Mohamed and his Maju group, and Tan Sri Halim Saad — but the government’s stance is not clear.Halim’s plan to take over PLUS Malaysia generated much interest as he used to control the Renong group and United Engineers Malaysia Bhd, which morphed into UEM after Khazanah took over the assets from him.There has also been interest reportedly shown in UEM’s stake in UEM Sunrise.A few years ago, there was talk of UEM Builders being hived off, but this has since died down.Other assets under the Khazanah banner that can be sold or have its shareholding pared down include Malaysia Airlines Bhd (wholly owned by Khazanah), Telekom Malaysia Bhd (where Khazanah has a 26.21% stake), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (28.14%) and semiconductor manufacturer SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/newsbreak-mohd-izani-likely-take-helm-uem,"2019-05-01 20:06:40"

It won’t do much good if a consumer has one of these e-wallets, but not being able to use it for all merchants.“In payments, if you don’t have ubiquity, things will eventually die off,” he said during a media briefing today.Schiesser said the interoperable QR codes will come into force in June this year. Following this, PayNet intends to roll-out other services related to payments collection by leveraging on RPP, which will likely be implemented in 2020.This includes the ability for consumers to set e-mandates to grant authority to service providers, such as Telekom Malaysia Bhd for example, to be able to automatically debit users’ accounts when payment is due.Secondly, PayNet is looking to implement real-time direct debit, which would open up the ability of prepaid services, such as for Touch n’ Go cards to be automatically topped up when the balance goes down to a certain limit.Thirdly, the RPP opens up the ability for request-to-pay, where a service provider like Tenaga Nasional Bhd could automatically send a request for payment for an electricity bill that is due in the form of an alert on a user’s mobile phone.The user can then access their respective banking app to pay the bill at their leisure.This function can also be used between users, whereby one user can request a payment from another user.“These are the sort of things that can be done with these intrinsic functions. They serve purposes in themselves but these different functions can also be combined and used in different ways,” said Schiesser.However, he said Malaysians are currently still very much reliant on cash as a force of habit, seeing as consumers are too comfortable with paying for goods and services with physical money, which has been a factor behind the relatively slow adoption of e-payments.He opined that the government plays an important role in changing the habits of consumers.“In certain aspects, the government has adopted e-payments but what I would like to personally see is for the government to do more around this. If the people get to interact more with the government through electronic means, the more likely it will be that they would use it elsewhere in their lives.“The government has been making some steps but I would really like to see if they can push it a bit more. The current government has been quite supportive of e-payments, so hopefully, we will move in that direction,” Schiesser said.Beyond Malaysia, PayNet is also looking to enable cross border instant credit transfer and peer-to-peer payments, with an initial focus on Southeast Asia.While there have been talks with neighbouring countries including Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, Schiesser said developments have been rather slow.“Things have been going a bit slower than we would like. There are no regulatory barriers for us to link the different nations’ systems, but it’s just that the countries are really focused on their own agendas — on developing their respective infrastructures,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysia-still-some-way-being-cashless-society-%E2%80%94-paynet,"2019-05-01 20:06:41"

Maintain underweight: Several Internet service providers have launched new high-speed broadband (HSBB) packages, leveraging on Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (TNB) fibre optic infrastructure in Jasin. 
TNB’s three-month pilot project in Jasin was implemented through the RM1 billion National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP) initiative announced in Budget 2019, and this has resulted in a successful rollout of new HSBB packages by Astro, Maxis, Digi, Celcom and City Broadband.Although this is negative to Telekom Malaysia (TM) as it introduces new competition into the fixed line broadband segment, connectivity is only restricted to limited areas covering 1,100 homes in Jasin. Impact on the respective players is expected to be immaterial but it remains to be seen whether TNB could also rollout similar arrangement with service providers in other locations throughout the country.Astro’s participation is within our expectations as we believe convergence is the key to remaining relevant in the fast-changing telecommunication and Internet industry. We believe this deal would be value accretive to Astro as we reckon that Astro’s 92% household penetration in Jasin is predominantly Astro NJOI, which does not generate any TV subscription revenue currently.However, any earnings contribution is not expected to be significant in the near term as this is only a trial project and it will depend on the take-up rate by the eligible households.Connectivity to underserved areas remains unanswered. At this juncture, we are still uncertain whether TNB is capable of rolling out HSBB in untapped areas that have yet to be connected with existing fibre network.If TNB can only provide services to areas that are already currently served by existing networks, then TNB has little differentiation from incumbent telco players apart from offering products at lower price points. Overall, we believe this could bring potential revenue growth to TNB through rental of the fibre infrastructure but earnings impact is expected to be insignificant to the group.City Broadband, which is TNB’s wholly-owned subsidiary, is among the broadband players participating in the pilot project. For TNB to compete directly against existing broadband players in a meaningful manner, we believe significant investment is required for last-mile connectivity. — PublicInvest Research, Jan 9",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/investment-lastmile-connectivity-seen-necessary-tnb,"2019-05-01 20:06:41"

(Jan 9, RM2.65)
Downgrade to sell with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM2.30: Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB, RM13.64, Buy, TP: RM18) yesterday rolled out its National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP) pilot project in Jasin, Melaka. TNB has about 12,000km of fibre-optic cables across the country and the group in September 2018 started a pilot project in Jasin to assess the technical, safety and commercial viability of using its infrastructure for the government’s NFCP to allow faster, cheaper and wider Internet accessibility. TNB in December 2018 said that the pilot project, technically, has been very successful.Under the pilot project, several Internet providers will offer packages to residents in Jasin, including Astro, Celcom, City Broadband, Digi and Maxis. Maxis and Celcom are the familiar names in the broadband space while the presence of Astro, Digi and City Broadband are noteworthy.The Edge reported that Astro (ASTRO, RM1.42, Buy, TP: RM1.77) has started a pilot project in Jasin, offering bundled broadband Internet with Astro’s Family Pack at RM99/month (50Mbps) and RM129/month (100Mbps) starting February 2019. The Astro’s Family Pack content offering includes channels like Astro Ria, Astro Prima and NatGeo WILD, among others. The new package is priced at a 23% discount to the existing 30Mbps Astro-Maxis IPTV package.A reputable blog on Malaysia telecommunication companies, soyacincau, reported that Digi (DIGI, RM4.44, Hold, TP: RM4.38) is offering broadband packages at RM95/month (50Mbps) and RM129/month (100Mbps).City Broadband, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TNB, offers competitive packages ranging from RM79/month (50Mbps) to RM199/month (1Gbps). City Broadband is a relatively new entrant to the broadband space and is currently focused in Cyberjaya.We do not expect the pilot project in Jasin to have any material earnings impact on its participants, considering the small coverage area involving only 1,100 households. There are few indications whether the current arrangements would evolve into a feasible long-term business plans. However, these pilot projects offer a glimpse into the possible business opportunities for the participants, as well as the likely implications on Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM).Assuming TNB, and the participants, are to roll out their respective packages nationwide under the following arrangements, we expect:• Astro to see an overall increase in paying subscribers, targeting the Astro NJOI upgraders. Astro’s new bundle package prices are competitive vis-à-vis the offerings from TM and the existing Astro-Maxis IPTV packages. The package looks especially attractive to new broadband subscribers and upgraders from the Astro NJOI (a free satellite television service).  • TNB to see earnings diversification, as the group may benefit as both the wholesaler and retailer (via City Broadband).• Maxis (MAXIS, RM5.64, Sell, TP: RM5) may leverage TNB’s network to expand its broadband coverage area, as per its broadband aspiration. This should help lower its capital expenditure requirements. However, higher participation from peers may increase the competition and erode its broadband margins.  • Digi has yet to unveil its long-term broadband plans. In view of its uncompetitive package prices (under the pilot project), we believe Digi is still at an exploratory phase regarding the broadband market.• TNB’s high-speed fibre network should provide an irresistible option for TM’s 1.1 million Streamyx subscribers, given the significant speed upgrades (30Mbps-50Mbps versus 1Mbps-8Mbps) and lower subscription prices. Elsewhere, the competitive product offerings from Maxis/City Broadband may lure TM’s 1.2 million unifi subscribers.We are downgrading TM to “sell” (from “hold”) with an unchanged discounted cash flow-derived TP of RM2.30, in view of higher downside risk to the share price — TM’s share price has rallied by 13% since its third quarter of financial year 2018 (3QFY18) results release on Nov 26, 2018; its current share price of RM2.61 implies 12% downside to our TP of RM2.30 — and the emergence of new competitor(s) in the broadband market. At 20 times FY19 estimate (FY19E) price-earnings ratio, TM’s valuation looks pricey, considering the challenging business environment, likely contraction in FY19E core earnings and its heavy balance sheet.Key risks to our negative view on TM are robust broadband subscriber growth/stable broadband average revenue per user, no changes in Streamyx package price, drastic cost rationalisation measures/changes in business strategy (that is, restructuring of Webe business), and stronger-than-expected earnings. — Affin Hwang Capital Research, Jan 9",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/new-competitors-broadband-market-seen-tm,"2019-05-01 20:06:41"

In particular, broadband giant Telekom Malaysia Bhd’s (TM) stocks were severely hit after Gobind announced the government’s demand for higher Internet speed with lower prices in the country.“For TM, which was bashed down in 2018, we have a ‘hold’ call because there is no catalyst for upside, and they have slashed dividends. [So] unless there are earnings surprises ...,” Lee said.For mobile network operators (MNOs), Lee expects them to remain cost-focused and focussed on improving cost efficiency this year.“Our top pick is Axiata Group Bhd, with a target price of RM4.95, as there are capital upside due to its exposure to the Asian region, and turnarounds at PT XL Axiata Tbk and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Dividend is also expected to improve,” he said.As for Digi.Com Bhd and Maxis Bhd, Lee said, JF Apex has them on ‘hold’ “as their businesses are limited to local subscribers and dividends are not attractive”.Meanwhile, MIDF Research analyst, Martin Foo, said the government’s move to break TM’s monopoly in the broadband market is expected to intensify competition in this space.“Tenaga Nasional Bhd is said to be launching its broadband package offering in January. We expect the new offering will be competitive to existing Unifi’s offerings with the aim to gain market share.“Besides, there were news which reported that several foreign broadband players have expressed their interests to venture into Malaysia, so not much of good news, and average revenue per user is not expected to be good as well due to the MSAP (mandatory standard on access pricing). So TM has to adjust to the new environment in 2019,” he said.MSAP is a price ceiling that wholesale network providers can charge other telco players who seek access to high speed broadband.Foo said while MNOs’ input cost is less with the MSAP, their share prices remain under pressure because of continuous competition — which is especially true for DiGi, as competition is more intense at the lower price range segment, where price sensitivity is higher.“DiGi and U Mobile Sdn Bhd will see their competition intensify. For Maxis and Celcom Axiata, they are aiming for the upmarkets, with different price points, [so] their impact is lower.“Having said that, our top pick is still DiGi. Because of the affordability of their packages, we believe they could attract more subscribers to their postpaid segment, while prepaid remains tough. Overall, we forecast earnings growth for all telco players, except for TM,” said Foo.Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Tan J Young said the telco industry should be muted in 2019 due to the lack of positive catalysts.Tan’s top pick is Time dotCom Bhd, as he views the stock as having the steadiest performance by declining the least in 2018.Unlike TM, Tan said Time dotCom is not as negatively affected by the MSAP as it is not an access provider to rivals in the retail market.“As such, price pressure should not be intense. On the contrary, the cellular companies (cellcos) should be trumpeting this move (MSAP implementation) as a cost-effective wholesale fibre would allow cellcos to reduce expenditure on backhaul high-speed transmission — a paramount ingredient for the success of fourth generation and beyond,” he said.In his note to investors in December, Maybank IB Research analyst Tan Chi Wei said the main downside risk for MNOs revolves around the emergence of a serious price war, particularly if one of the Big Three — Maxis, Digi and Celcom Axiata — starts to reduce prices significantly.“Meanwhile, regulatory scrutiny would likely shift towards the mobile space, where we believe the overall regulatory pressure would be substantially more benign (relative to fixed line broadband).“[but] we think it is unlikely that the minister would exert downward pressure on price points, given that he has previously expressed his satisfaction with mobile price trends and competitive intensity,” he added.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/no-reprieve-seen-yet-telcos,"2019-05-01 20:06:41"

Here are the laggard sectors, with construction being the worst hit Construction hit by cancellations, defermentsThe construction sector was one of the worst-performing sectors on Bursa Malaysia, with most of the decline coming post-GE14 as the cancellation and deferment of contracts by the new administration affected approved and awarded rail jobs.Year to date (Dec 21), the Bursa Malaysia Construction Index has fallen more than 50%.Among the projects affected are the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail project, which will be deferred for two years, and the East Coast Rail Link, which was still under review at the time of writing.CIMB Equity Research analyst Sharizan Rosely says in a recent strategy report that the construction sector is likely to enter a downward cycle, given the subdued outlook for contract awards. He foresees a downside to the order books of the bigger contractors arising from the impact of the cost rationalisation of the light rail transit Line 3 (LRT3) and mass rapid transit Line 2 (MRT2), lower construction profit per annum arising from project delays and extensions of time and the risk of margin markdowns or provisions due to the substantial scaling down of the scope of some projects.“Our top big-cap ‘sell’ is Gamuda Bhd and top small- or mid-cap ‘sell’ calls are on Protasco Bhd and Salcon Bhd. Our top ‘buy’ is Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd for its overseas exposure, undemanding valuations and high return on equity,” Sharizan says.Affin Hwang Investment Bank Sdn Bhd is also cautious on the construction sector due to potential earnings risks from profit margin squeeze and reduction in contract values.Nonetheless, Affin Hwang analyst Loong Chee Wei says in his strategy report that most construction companies are now trading at sharp discounts to their revised net asset value.“The current weighted-average, sector-expected 2019 core price-earnings ratio of 11 times is reasonable, considering core 2019 expected earnings per share growth of 12% year on year,” he says, reiterating the investment bank’s “neutral” weighting on the sector.On the other hand, MIDF Equity Research has maintained a positive view on the sector despite the near-term swing in direction.“This was mainly a recognition of the stable development expenditure allocation in Budget 2019, continuation of mega projects — LRT3, MRT2 and Pan Borneo Highway, to name a few — and pending implementation of infrastructure projects, [including] the Coastal Road, Second Link Road and state water grid projects,” it says in its Dec 17 strategy report.It adds that some stocks are trading at attractive levels following the heavy selldown this year. They include Gabungan AQRS Bhd and Muhibbah Engineering. MIDF also has “buy” calls on Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd and KKB Engineering Bhd, which could benefit from the pending rollout of Sarawak infrastructure developments. Genting's luck runs out THE PH administration’s first budget delivered a major blow to Genting Malaysia Bhd with the first increase in gaming tax in 20 years. Genting Malaysia lost more than RM1.24 billion in market capitalisation in just a few minutes, shortly before Bursa’s closing bell, while its parent company, Genting Bhd, saw RM2.23 billion wiped off of its market cap. The selldown occurred after Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng announced that casino duties will be raised to 35% from 25% on gross gaming income and gaming machine duties to 30% from 20% on gross collection, as well as the increase of annual casino licence fees by RM30 million to RM150 million and machine dealer’s licence to RM50,000 from RM10,000 a year. Then, in November, Genting Malaysia announced that it was suing Fox Entertainment Group LLC and The Walt Disney Co for US$1 billion for terminating an agreement to develop a 20th Century Fox World theme park in Genting Highlands. This has led to uncertainty over the development of Genting Malaysia’s new outdoor theme park.And, if things were not bad enough, Genting Bhd’s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which is developing the Resorts World Las Vegas property, has found itself entangled in a lawsuit with US-based casino operator Wynn Resorts Holdings LLC.Wynn Resorts is suing Resorts World Las Vegas LLC, a unit of Genting, on claims that the architectural design embodied in the Resorts World Las Vegas hotel and casino is substantially similar to Wynn Las Vegas, Encore and Wynn Macau.It is also worth noting that Genting Malaysia suffered its largest quarterly loss of RM1.49 billion for the third quarter ended Sept 30 (3QFY2018) due to an impairment on its investment in promissory notes issued by the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe for the development of an integrated gaming resort in Massachusetts, US.Amid the negative news and developments, Genting Malaysia and Genting have seen YTD declines of 44% and 30.1% respectively, based on their closing on Dec 21. E-government players hurt by change in governmentMY EG Services Bhd (MyEG) saw 29.8%, or RM2.78 billion, of its market capitalisation wiped out on May 14, the first trading day post-GE14, as companies seen as linked to the previous administration saw heavy selling pressure.It was the company’s largest decline in a single day since 2008. Adding to the pressure is the concern over the loss of income from its Goods and Services Tax (GST) monitoring project with the scrapping of the GST and the reintroduction of the Sales and Services Tax.While there was a recovery following the heavy selldown, MyEG’s share price came under selling pressure again this month following the decision to scrap the RM3.5 billion national immigration control system (SKIN) project. Prestariang Bhd was affected by the termination of the project, in which it holds a 70% stake. Its share price plunged more than 40% during the week the termination was announced, while the share prices of MyEG and Scicom (MSC) Bhd were also affected.Other e-government services providers include Dagang NeXchange Bhd (DNeX), Datasonic Group Bhd and Iris Corporation Bhd, which fell 5.2%, 8.4% and 6.5% respectively, on May 14.The average YTD decline of e-government services providers is 50.8%.Analysts have mixed views on the various e-government services providers. Most analysts covering MyEG continue to be positive on its prospects for 2019, despite seeing its share price fall by more than 50% YTD. In fact, six out of seven analysts covering it have a “buy” call on MyEG with only one calling a “sell”. Its average 12-month target price is RM1.82, indicating a potential upside of more than 100%.On the other hand, three of the analysts covering Prestaring have downgraded the company to “sell” with an average target price of 24 sen, indicating further downside to its current price of 35 sen per share.Analysts were more neutral on Datasonic with one “buy” and one “hold” recommendation with a 12-month average target price of 45 sen apiece, which is close to its closing price of 43 sen on Dec 21.DNeX was also favoured by analysts, with all three having a “buy” call with an average target price of 41 sen, indicating a potential upside of 86.4%. Regulatory pressure and competitive market hurt telcosTHE telecommunications (telco) sector came under pressure from both the regulators and a competitive market. In fact, it was so bad that Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) was removed from the FBM KLCI constituents in the year-end review after the sharp decline of its share price.YTD, the telco giant has dropped 56.5%, and has seen RM13.6 billion wiped off its market value — the biggest loss in market cap over one year since the 2008 global financial crisis, when more than RM27.5 billion was erased.The selldown was mainly due to the May 22 announcement by Minister of Communications and Multimedia Gobind Singh Deo that he would work towards improving broadband connections at lower prices. This led to an agreement by the country’s four key telcos TM, Maxis Bhd, TIME dotCom Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd, on the mandatory standard on access pricing, which will result in lower fixed broadband prices.Being the largest fixed broadband market player, investors see TM as the company that will be impacted the most. There is also concern that the reform could put TM’s monopoly in the fixed broadband space at risk. This year, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) announced that it will be running a pilot project in Melaka to test the viability of providing broadband services through its fibre-optic network.Apart from that, changes in TM’s management team added to investor concerns. At the end of November, Imri Mokhtar was appointed acting group CEO, the third person to take the helm at TM this year, after Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazali Ramly resigned in June, followed by his successor Datuk Bazlan Osman’s resignation a few months later.Other telco players also found themselves under pressure in a competitive market. Axiata’s share price has fallen 28.2% YTD, while Digi.Com Bhd fell 11%. TIME dotCom was also down 9.8% while the best performer in the sector, Maxis, also saw a decline of 6.8%.Despite the sharp selldown, most analysts remain cautious on the sector’s earnings outlook for 2019.“We expect Maxis to report lower 2019 earnings after the termination of the U-Mobile RAN sharing agreement in late 2018. TM should see a steep earnings decline due to intensifying competition and lower broadband prices. Axiata should deliver the highest earnings growth due to a low base effect and operational improvement at its overseas entities, [though]macro headwinds may weigh on its overseas profitability,” Isaac Chow, an analyst at Affin Hwang says.Nonetheless, he maintains a “neutral” call on the sector, as the lacklustre earnings outlook is somewhat compensated for by the 4% yield. Oil and gas sector falls short of expectations as oil prices collapseEXPECTATIONS for the oil and gas industry, which had been tipped as a dark horse for 2018, were high for some fund managers at the start of the year, but optimism turned into volatility, and then panic going into the final quarter.The price of Brent crude had been on a steady upward trend until early October, when it reached its recent high of US$86.29 per barrel. However, it did not take long for the price to collapse and drop below the US$60 per barrel level to US$53.82 on Dec 21, on concerns over a weakening global economy and surging US crude output and falling stock prices.The decline continued despite the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and Russia-led allies agreeing to slash production.It is worth noting that most O&G counters on Bursa Malaysia were in the red, including Sapura Energy Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Velesto Energy Bhd and Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd. Dialog Group Bhd and Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd were among the few O&G players that managed to chalk up gains.YTD (Dec 21) Sapura Energy has fallen 57.8%, Bumi Armada, 79.1%, Velesto Energy, 42.6%, and Barakah Offshore by 84.5%. Dialog and Serba Dinamik recorded total returns of 20.7% and 15.6% respectively.Maybank Investment Bank Research analyst Liaw Thong Jung writes in a recent strategy report that the Opec+’s (comprising Opec and 14 non-Opec countries) latest pact to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan 1 will be closely monitored.“A strong compliance will shape 2019 positively. A break-up, or poor execution, will reverse all that and a volatile market will ensue. We estimate the oil price to average US$65 per barrel, a level that would instil confidence,” Liaw says, adding that Dialog and Yinson Holdings Bhd are his top “buy” calls in the sector. He is also calling a “buy” on Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MHB), Sapura Energy and Velesto Energy.Affin Hwang’s Tan Jianyuan agrees with Liaw that share prices in this space have mostly bottomed out, with a select few staging a recovery.“Based on consensus estimates, aggregate sector earnings will see a stronger 13% year-on-year growth in 2019 against our coverage universe of 14%, driven by a turnaround or recovery of a few ... companies like Sapura Energy, MISC Bhd, MHB and Velesto Energy. Risks to earnings lie in movement of the ringgit, oil prices and capital expenditure spending,” Tan says, adding that he has a “buy” call on Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd and Serba Dinamik. Plantations continue to underperformCRUDE palm oil (CPO) prices struggled near a three-year low of RM1,965 per metric ton (MT) in November, as the benchmark palm oil contract for January delivery hovered at RM1,972 per MT with rising inventories weighing on market and physical demand. On Dec 21, CPO futures were trading at RM2,157 per MT.This has weighed on the share prices of many plantation counters. FGV Holdings Bhd was one of the worst performers as it fell 55.9% YTD (Dec 21). IJM Plantations Bhd was down 47.7%, IOI Corp Bhd, 1%, and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd fell 1.3% during the same period.The Bursa Malaysia Plantation Index declined 13.8% YTD.Affin Hwang analyst Nadia Aquidah says the current low CPO price is unlikely to sustain in the first quarter of 2019 as world palm oil consumption is expected to exceed production as seasonal declines in production take hold, thus reducing stocks.“As we expect inventory levels to slowly decline with higher consumption and the export of palm oil products, we think CPO prices could improve in 2019 onwards to RM2,400 to RM2,500 per MT (from an estimated average of RM2,200 to RM2,250 for this year). Sector-wise, we maintain our “neutral” rating for the plantation sector,” Nadia says.Maybak Investment Bank analyst Ong Chee Ting agrees, saying in a report that the new threshold for Indonesia’s export tax is a possible game changer for the industry, which provides a more level playing field for Malaysian exporters.Ong adds that the El Niño climate cycle might make a comeback early next year, and could disrupt the soybean supply during South America’s ongoing planting season.“Our sector valuation remains fair, hence, our “neutral” weight. For a trade, investors can position themselves after an expected weak 4Q2018 results season in February 2019, ahead of a potential CPO price recovery in 2Q2019. However, longer-term investors should consider bottom fishing for bombed-out small- to mid-cap stocks as stock prices tend to mean-revert over the long run,” Ong says.Ivy Ng, at CIMB Equity, agrees with both, saying that CPO prices are expected to average RM2,400 per MT in 2019, higher than the first 11 months’ average price of RM2,267 in Malaysia.“We expect oil palm players to report a mixed earnings performance in 2019. We believe upstream planters with strong fresh fruit bunch output growth should report better earnings, driven by higher output and CPO prices. However, this will be partially offset by higher labour and fertiliser costs as well as depreciation charges,” Ng says in a report.   ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/disappointments-year-year-full-disappointments-bursa,"2019-05-01 20:06:42"

Maintain neutral on the sector: Regulatory overhang remains a key sector risk, highlighted by the Pakatan Harapan government’s commitment to resume the former government’s agenda to “double the speed at half the price”.The new Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) chairman, Al-Ishsal Ishak, who was appointed on Oct 1 this year, has warned that he would ensure the government’s objective to provide high-speed broadband nationwide is achieved with some operators likely to be reprimanded over regulatory breaches.Additionally, the government’s intention to reduce Khazanah Nasional’s holdings in government-linked companies (GLCs) casts shadows of a share overhang.The impact of lower fixed broadband average revenue per user (Arpu)s has been deferred to fourth quarter of financial year 2018 (4QFY18). Even though Telekom Malaysia (TM)’s 3QFY18 results showed a surprisingly resilient unifi Arpu, we do not expect this segment to defy gravity with the almost 40% price cut in its 30Mbps plan to RM79 per month, which was announced in early July and expected to be gradually implemented by the end of this year.As such, we expect customers’ gradual migration towards the more affordable government-mandated plans to substantively cut TM’s immediate earnings.With Maxis riding along with TM’s price cuts, we expect lower margins from fixed broadband, as forewarned by Time DotCom chief executive officer despite registering a strong 3QFY18 performance.As revenue growth increasingly faces headwinds, telcos are increasingly focused on higher value customers, optimising existing assets and drive cost efficiencies via lower tower rental reversion rates, single supplier sourcing for bulk discounts and digitalisation initiatives.Overall, 3Q18 mobile subscribers declined 177,000 quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and 781,000 year-on-year (y-o-y) to 32 million primarily in the prepaid segment amid tight competition and ongoing SIM consolidation.Since the beginning of this year, Celcom registered the largest decline of 316,000 followed by Maxis’ 120,000. DiGi managed to grow by 57,000 as post-paid accretion more than offset the prepaid loss.However, cumulative nine months of 2018 sector revenue was flattish as the decline in prepaid subscribers was offset by the higher value post-paid segment, which expanded by 155,000 q-o-q and 406,000 y-o-y in 3Q18 to 8.7 million.A sector rerating requires catalysts for stronger revenue growth prospects demonstrated by subscriber, Arpu and margin expansions.As the global landscape for rapid data trajectory is driven by lower price plans and increasingly expensive capital expenditure rollouts to provide wider fixed broadband and 4G capabilities, coverage and service quality, any significant organic revenue or margin growth improvement is unlikely over the next 12 months.We maintain a “neutral” call given the continued intense competition in both the mobile and fixed broadband markets. — AmInvestment Bank, Dec 19",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/regulatory-overhang-key-risk-telco-sector,"2019-05-01 20:06:48"
386,"December 19, 2018 15:00 pm +08",TM,"Green Packet looking at breaking even ","BLEEDING red ink in all but one year in the last decade, the inevitable question for the management of Green Packet Bhd is a simple one: When does the group expect to return to profitability?Widely known as the technology developer of WiMAX software solutions, Green Packet founded wireless broadband provider Packet One Networks (M) Sdn Bhd (P1), now known as Webe Digital Sdn Bhd.Loss-making P1 was generally perceived as a burden on Green Packet over the years as it rapidly burnt cash to build new infrastructure, dragging down the latter’s bottom line. Green Packet registered total losses of over RM1 billion between its financial years ended Dec 31, 2008 (FY2008), and FY2017.It did eke out a profit of RM70.66 million in FY2016 but that was just a drop in an ocean of red. FY2016 marked its first return to the black since 2008 because of the cessation of equity-accounting of share of losses in an associate company as Webe was no longer one from July 2016.Although Green Packet has been paring its majority stake in Webe — then known as P1 — by selling to Telekom Malaysia Bhd since September 2014, it still owns 18.9% of the company.Green Packet’s turnaround in FY2016 was short-lived as the group slipped back into the red a year later with a net loss of RM16.57 million, followed by a loss of RM31 million for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2018, on revenue of RM302 million. As at Sept 30 this year, the group’s total accumulated losses stood at RM464.33 million.According to Green Packet CEO and executive director Tan Kay Yen, the company aims to break even by FY2020. “Our priority is to expand our revenue and subsequently, improve our margins. But our long-term plan is to build recurring income,” he tells The Edge in an interview.Tan, who was appointed to Green Packet’s board on Oct 7, 2014, has more than 24 years of experience in sales, operations and management in the financial, IT, telecommunications and technology sectors.Green Packet’s present businesses are anchored in three key segments, namely communications, solutions as well as digital services, a new division that was started in FY2017.Tan says Webe is not within these three business segments as it is merely a passive investment for Green Packet. “We have seen a difference (following the paring of the majority stake in Webe) because there is no longer a top-line and bottom-line impact on the group.”Moving forward, Tan says the digital services division will be Green Packet’s new focus, although he acknowledges that this business segment will continue to be loss-making in FY2019 as it is still in investing mode.“Let me put it this way, once our digital services division breaks even, our group should break even too, that’s for sure. The other two segments (communications and solutions) should be profit-making in normal circumstances.”Green Packet’s bread-and-butter communications division offers services like Mobile Virtual Network Operator, mobile reload, games, video content, remittance and data bundles. It also operates one of the largest wholesale voice carriers for international voice traffic and mobile content distribution in Asia.“We have seen an improvement in the communications segment with a top-line growth of over 20% (in 3QFY2018) but this is a low-margin business. Although there is a margin squeeze, we will continue to expand revenue in this segment so that we can protect the bottom line.”As for the company’s solutions division, which comprises software and devices, Tan says it remains challenging as it made a loss after tax of RM3.25 million in 9MFY2018 compared with a profit after tax of RM1.86 million a year ago.This is the only business segment that saw a year-on-year decline in revenue — down a significant 62% to RM28.95 million in 9MFY2018.Under this division, Green Packet supplies indoor and outdoor devices for fixed and mobile wireless internet connectivity to cellular operators worldwide. It also customises devices for video broadcast operators and provides a platform for users to access content.The next growth engine for Green Packet will be its digital services division, which is made up of Internet-of-Things (IoT), financial technology (fintech) and media businesses. The group also owns 32% of locally listed G3 Global Bhd, which is a clothing retailer and IoT solutions provider.“We will be investing in the digital services segment until FY2019, which is why it will even out profits from the other two segments. All in all, at the operating level, we should be looking at break-even or slight profit soon,” Tan states.The drivers of the fintech initiative under its digital services division will be its newly launched apps kiplePark, kiplePay and kipleHome.kiplePark is essentially a cashless, ticketless and frictionless solution that enables the payment of parking fees via mobile phone for various types of parking services.“We have launched kiplePark at about 20 shopping malls and offices in the Klang Valley. Our next idea — licence plate recognition (LPR) — will come to fruition in two shopping malls in the Klang Valley towards January next year,” says Tan.LPR technology will change the whole parking experience, he contends, as shoppers can just drive into the mall, whereon the barrier gate will automatically open because the camera attached to it recognises a car by reading its licence plate.“You literally do not have to do anything. (As) for a parking ticket, you still need to pull out your wallet and cash or tap your card.”kiplePay is a platform for both consumers and merchants as it enables cashless transactions through a payment gateway (B2B) and e-wallet (B2C). “kiplePay is not an e-wallet for everybody but is meant for a certain community. We do not want to go into the red ocean space,” Tan remarks.kiplePay has been introduced in Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), whose students can use the app to pay for everything on campus, whether it is at the mamak shop, convenience store or bookshop.The third app is kipleHome, a platform and service that acts as a bridge between property management and residents as its features include managing visitors’ e-pass, bill payments, facility booking, private messaging and news announcements.“If I am staying in a gated housing area and I know you will be visiting me, I will send you a dynamic QR code for one-time use via WhatsApp. You don’t need to download the app. You just scan the QR code (and) the guard will know that I have authorised you to come in.

That gave a market breadth of 0.31 indicating the bears were in control,” it said.AllianceDBS Research said the market saw selling activity on Dec 18 with the benchmark index reaching a low of 1,626.93.It said the lower low did not come as a surprise because many market participants were concerned about the market development after the downside breakout of the 1,650 level on Dec 17.“This concern turned into anxiety which can be seen from the opening level of 1,628.47 that was close to the day’s low of 1,626.93.“This suggested a weak follow through selling pressure soon after the opening bell.“At the day’s low of 1,626.93, market participants were seen unwilling to be aggressive in their selling game because market had lost 51 points in 3 days measuring from the high of 1,677.91 (Dec 13) to the low of 1,626.93 (Dec 18),” it said.The research house said following the off day’s low down close on Dec 18, there should be buying attempt with immediate hurdle at 1,650.“The analysis of overall market action on Dec 18 revealed that buying power was stronger than selling pressure.“As such, FBMKLCI would likely trade above the 1,643.88 level on Dec 19,” said AllianceDBS Research.Based on corporate announcements and news flow yesterday, companies in focus today may include: FGV Holdings Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Transocean Holdings Bhd, Crescendo Corp Bhd, Comfort Gloves Bhd, Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd and Prestariang Bhd.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/klci-remain-lacklustre-immediate-hurdle-1650,"2019-05-01 20:06:51"

On Nov 28, Mitsui agreed to buy 1.4 billion shares or a 16% stake in IHH from a unit of Khazanah for RM8.42 billion or RM6 a share, raising its holding to 32.9%. Khazanah’s stake will be reduced to 26.1%. The expected holdings are counted based on IHH’s enlarged share capital once IHH’s acquisition of 30% equity interest in Acibadem Saglik Yatirimlari Holdings A.S is completed. The transaction, which forms an important part of Khazanah’s portfolio restructuring, is subject to regulatory approvals and the completion of the Acibadem acquisition.The agreed price of RM6 a share was a 14.3% premium to its closing price of RM5.25 on Nov 28. IHH shares hit a high of RM5.50 on Nov 29 before moderating to close at RM5.41 on Dec 5, down 3.06% from a year ago.At Complete Logistic Services Bhd, the Law family, led by founder and managing director Law Hee Ling, further increased its control of the company.

Data shows 90.3 million shares changed hands in a single direct deal at 35.5 sen on Nov 22, 2.9% above the prevailing market price of 34.5 sen.Recall that Mulpha International had proposed to distribute up to 90.3 million shares in Mudajaya to its shareholders as dividend-in-specie as the group looks to streamline its business and sell non-core investments. Notable movementsMy E.G.

The gain was in contrast to the sharp decline seen across regional stock markets. The company’s own share buyback activities may have also lent some support.

393,"December 17, 2018 09:07 am +08",TM,"Competitiveness lacking in manufacturing","KUALA LUMPUR: Canned pineapples, sugar and tobacco may seem to have little in common, but they are the products of Malaysia’s least competitive manufacturing industries.For the pineapple canning industry as well as sugar factories and refineries, there are only four firms or fewer that control the total output. This, said Universiti Utara Malaysia senior lecturer Muhammad Ridhuan Bos Abdullah, indicates that these industries are governed by perfect monopolies.Muhammad Ridhuan has undertaken a research analysing the concentration ratio (a ratio that indicates the size of a firm in relation to its industry) of manufacturing industries in Malaysia.Sectors such as tobacco manufacturing and the manufacture of rubber footwear were found to have a high concentration of output from the top four firms. (See table).The lack of competitiveness in the manufacturing sectors is not isolated to Malaysia. A 2014 report by the World Bank found that over half of the manufacturing industries lacked trade competitiveness.Muhammad Ridhuan acknowledged that some of the manufacturing industries had high barriers to entry due to their capital-intensive nature.That being said, his research shows a number of manufacturing industries with high levels of competitiveness, including rice milling, manufacturing of refined palm oil, and the manufacturing of motor vehicle parts and accessories.“My recommendation to policymakers is that they should look at [all] industries. [Find out] which ones are driven by technological innovation and those which, at the same time, [encourage] competition,” Muhammad Ridhuan told The Edge Financial Daily.Factors that may affect the concentration ratio include economies of scale, regulatory frameworks, and the industry’s size and life cycle, he said.The Competition Act 2010, which came into effect on Jan 1, 2012, appears to have had a positive impact. Between 2010 and 2015, there was a growth in the number of firms in competitive industries and a decline in non-competitive ones. (See table).According to Professor Dr Saadiah Mohamad, a member of the Malaysia Competition Commission (MyCC), the introduction of competition policies has been found to improve market efficiency, consumer welfare and, ultimately, economic growth.“These studies were not confined to Western economies, but also Japan, South Korea and other developing economies,” she said at the National Economic Outlook Conference organised by the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research last week. MyCC lacking in expertise, jurisdictionGoverned by the Competition Commission Act 2010, MyCC has the power to investigate and enforce the act on all companies, except in a number of “natural monopolies”, such as energy, aviation and upstream petroleum revenue, as well as multimedia and communications.Although MyCC has taken action in cases such as MyEG Services Bhd’s supply of foreign worker permits in 2016, its lack of action in relation to ride-sharing giant Grab’s merger with Uber’s Southeast Asian operations has been questioned.In contrast, Singapore’s competition regulator, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, fined both parties a total of S$13 million (close to RM40 million) in September, just six months after the merger was announced.According to Saadiah, the reason why Malaysia has been unable to take any action against the merger itself is because the law does not include provisions that empower MyCC to investigate mergers.“If there is evidence of the abuse of dominant positions, then the law provides for that, [and we] can investigate [the case],” she said.However, she noted that the advancement of digital technology had also been a challenge. “Competition authorities need to be well versed in the algorithms used to [price Grab’s services],” she said, adding that the man on the street may not be knowledgeable enough to file complaints regarding the ride-hailing firm’s pricing mechanism.Apart from private players, the competitiveness of government-linked companies (GLCs) must also be scrutinised, said Ali Salman, the chief executive officer of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.“If GLCs are subject to competition, then I think they can be under government ownership and still perform. But Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) and Tenaga Nasional Bhd still receive some sort of protection from the government. That means they are not efficient in terms of market exposure,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.Ali acknowledged that certain government-backed firms serve the dual functions of supporting social welfare and delivering financial returns.However, comparing the investments made by national oil firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) and companies like Norway’s Equinor, a government-backed public listed company formerly known as Statoil, he noted that Petronas had filed fewer intellectual property rights than its peers.“We haven’t seen research and development to be very helpful for industrial growth, [in what is] otherwise a very good business environment,” he said.On the telecommunications scene, Malaysia ranks 74 out of 167 countries for fixed broadband services, according to the World Bank. It noted that the nation’s high-speed broadband prices are also relatively high compared with other countries.The bank attributed this to the fact that TM holds a significantly larger market share versus its peers in other countries.Meanwhile, Ali has compared the figures to Malaysia’s 15th ranking last year for ease of doing business, concluding that any analysis of GLCs operating in inefficient markets is restricted by a lack of opportunities for empirical analysis.“Because GLCs are not fully exposed to market factors, we cannot truly evaluate the efficiency and economic [effects] on them,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/competitiveness-lacking-manufacturing,"2019-05-01 20:06:53"

There are 170 members in the club this year.As recognition is the best reward for accomplishments, it is The Edge’s hope that the awards continue to encourage more companies to strive even harder for excellence.
THE AWARDS
The sectoral awards are:
The 17 categories are:
THE EDGE BRC SECTORAL CORPORATE AWARDSTo be eligible for the corporate awards, a BRC member must have been listed at least four calendar years before the end-March cut-off date in the current year, as companies are evaluated on their financial performance over three years.The methodology for the corporate awards is both stringent and transparent, with the results audited by Deloitte Malaysia. The data used to determine the companies that qualify for The Edge BRC membership and winners of The Edge BRC Corporate Awards is provided by Asia Analytica Data Sdn Bhd as well as extracted from Bloomberg.Members eligible for the Highest Return on Equity Over Three Years and Highest Growth in Profit After Tax Over Three Years awards must be profitable every year throughout the evaluation period. For this year, the evaluation period is from FY2014 to FY2017. Calculation for PAT growth is also subject to a risk-weight factor component to recognise the importance of consistency in profit delivery throughout the evaluation period.Winners for The Edge BRC Highest Returns to Shareholders award are judged purely based on total return, consisting of share price gains and dividends over a three-year period. The cut-off date this year was June 30.The annual end-March cut-off date for BRC membership was unchanged due to the need to source CR information for the judges’ consideration.Companies with scores within 0.5 point of each other are deemed to be of the same rank in determining the winner. There could, therefore, be cases of joint winners for the awards.
THE EDGE BRC BEST CR INITIATIVES AWARDEligible companies are evaluated by a panel of judges on their CR initiatives. The Edge BRC Best CR Initiatives award is presented to companies with the top average scores in three categories: Super Big Cap (companies with over RM40 billion in market capitalisation), Big Cap (companies with RM10 billion to RM40 billion in market capitalisation) and companies with less than RM10 billion market capitalisation. The panel is selected by The Edge and the evaluation criteria are based on the three focal areas spelt out by Bursa Malaysia’s Sustainability Reporting Guide for Public Listed Companies — economic, social and environmental. CR scores account for 30% of the evaluation for The Edge BRC Company of the Year award.

VALUE CREATOR: OUTSTANDING CEO OF MALAYSIAThe winner(s) of this award is determined by The Edge based on an assessment of the person’s contribution to value creation for his/her company. Here, value creation is reflected in the company’s market valuation, return to shareholders and stakeholders, revenue and profit growth as well as employment creation. To be chosen, the CEO must have achieved outstanding success in all these areas. Assessment starts from when the person became CEO of the company. The Edge has absolute discretion in deciding on this exclusive award and can choose not to name a winner — as was the case in 2011 and 2015.In 2010, the award went to Tan Sri Teh Hong Piow and Datuk Seri Nazir Razak for their outstanding contribution to their respective banking groups, Public Bank Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.In 2012, the recipients were AmBank Group founder and chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim and AirAsia Bhd co-founder and group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes. Azman remains a financier for all seasons, while Fernandes won for his role in transforming Asia’s aviation industry.In 2013, the award went to Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar and Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin, former president and CEO of S P Setia Bhd. Abdul Wahid was recognised for his leadership during his tenure as CEO of Renong Bhd (2001 to 2004), Telekom Malaysia Bhd (2004 to 2008) and Malayan Banking Bhd (2008 to 2013), while Liew won for his contribution at S P Setia, a company he left in April 2015 (after about 18 years) for niche developer Eco World Development Holdings Bhd.In 2014, the award went to Sunway Group founder and executive chairman Tan Sri Jeffrey Cheah and Axiata Group Bhd president and group CEO Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim for having shown exemplary leadership in building businesses and creating value for all stakeholders.In 2015, the award went to Khazanah Nasional Bhd managing director Tan Sri Azman Mokhtar, who was instrumental in not only transforming the institution but also the collective transformation of 20 government-linked companies across varied industries.Last year, the award went to self-made billionaire Tan Sri G Gnanalingam, executive chairman and co-founder of Westports Holdings Bhd.

Market performances globally were bearish last week, led by the US market. Furthermore, the ringgit got weaker towards the end of last week. However, the index was supported by telecommunications companies.The benchmark KLCI closed firm at 1,680.54 points last Friday from the previous week. The index continued to fall this week and closed at 1,652.63 points yesterday.Trading volume fell last week and this indicated that the market was being more cautious. The average daily trading volume declined to 2.3 billion shares from 2.8 billion in the previous week, while the average daily trading value fell to RM2.1 billion from RM3.6 billion.Market participation was mixed. Local institutions were net sellers. Net selling by local institutions was RM34.2 million, while net buying by local retailers and foreign institutions were RM34.2 million and RM2.9 million respectively.For the KLCI, gainers outpaced decliners eight to seven. Top gainers were Telekom Malaysia Bhd (+12% in a week to RM2.61), Axiata Group Bhd (+6.9% in a week to RM3.88) and Digi.Com Bhd (+5.9% to RM4.49). The top three decliners were Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-3.8% to RM13.70), PPB Group Bhd (-3.4% to RM17) and Nestle (M) Bhd (-3.3% to RM144.50).Markets closed generally lower except for China. In Asia, the decline was led by Japan’s Nikkei 225 index which fell 3% in a week. In Europe, Germany’s DAX and the UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell to a two-year low. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.5% in a week.The US dollar weakened against major currencies. The US dollar index rose to 96.7 points last Friday from 97.3 points at the end of the week before. The ringgit continued to strengthen to RM4.16 per US dollar, compared with RM4.18 in the previous week.Brent crude oil snapped an eight-week decline and rebounded last week as Opec cut production. The price rose 4.6% in a week to US$61.40 (RM256.65) per barrel last Friday. Commodity exchange gold increased 2.3% from the previous week to US$1,254.00 an ounce. Locally, crude palm oil fell 2% to RM1,998 last Friday.The KLCI is testing the immediate support level at 1,670 points after failing to rebound and test the resistance at 1,720 points. Chart-wise, the KLCI trend has remained bearish below the short-term 30-day moving average and the long-term 200-day moving average. Furthermore, the index has stayed below the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The expanding Cloud indicator downwards indicates that the bearish momentum is gaining traction.The Relative Strength Index and momentum oscillator have failed to climb above their mid-levels, and this indicates that the market still faces resistance. Furthermore, the moving average convergence divergence has almost fallen below its trigger line.A breakout of the KLCI above the resistance level of 1,720 points would indicate that the market is ready for a technical rebound but a breakout below the support level could mean a continuation of the bearish trend.However, the technical indicators on the chart favour a breakout to below the support line. So far this week, the index has fallen below the support line, and hence, the bearish trend is expected to continue towards the triangle pattern’s target of 1,610 points.The above commentary is solely used for educational purposes and is the writer’s point of view using technical analysis.

Over the last two months, the Malaysian gaming juggernaut’s,   share price fell by more than 40% and that of its parent, Genting Bhd, dropped 18% as the bad news kept coming.And just when shareholders thought the worst was over, following a 10% hike in casino duties, Genting Malaysia announced that it was suing 21st Century Fox and its soon-to-be new owner, Walt Disney Co, for pulling out of an agreement for a Fox World theme park at its casino resort.Then, last Friday, Genting Malaysia posted a net loss of RM1.49 billion for the period ended Sept 30, 2018 — its first in 10 years. It saw a net loss of RM387.8 million in the quarter ended Dec 31, 2008.The group’s losses were mainly due to higher impairment on certain assets relating to the Malaysian operations, amounting to RM58.5 million, and an impairment of RM1.83 billion on its investment in promissory notes issued by the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe for the development of an integrated gaming resort in Massachusetts, the US.“The impairment loss was due to the uncertainty of recovery of the notes following the US government’s decision in September 2018 to have the land in trust for an integrated gaming resort development,” according to Genting Malaysia’s filing with Bursa Malaysia.Its parent, Genting, also slipped into the red with a net loss of RM275.8 million for the quarter ended Sept 30, compared to a net profit of RM190 million in 3QFY2017. However, it is worth noting that most analysts have cautioned on the potential impairment loss prior to the release of the financials.Analysts were disappointed by management’s refusal in a conference call last Friday to provide clarity on the status of the outdoor theme park (OTP) following Genting’s lawsuit against Fox and Disney.“I think most of us are really very disappointed as this is the most pressing matter at the moment. Management should be more transparent about the details of the issues related to the theme park,” an analyst says, adding that the lack of clarity is hardly a boost for investor confidence.Most research houses see the legal proceedings involving Disney and Fox as a negative surprise and slashed their earnings forecasts for Genting Malaysia and Genting as most had expected higher visitor arrivals to Genting Highlands in 2019 and 2020, with the opening of the theme park in the first half of next year. Recall that management had targeted to achieve 30 million visitor arrivals annually by 2020, with the OTP acting as a catalytic crowd-puller that would enhance casino visitation and overall spending in FY2019 and FY2020.Bloomberg data reveals that at least six analysts downgraded their target prices and recommendations for Genting Malaysia last month alone. Nonetheless, the consensus target price of RM3.83 is still 33.9% higher than its closing price last Friday.As for Genting, most analysts have maintained their recommendations with an average target price of RM9.23, indicating a potential return of 47% based on its closing price of RM6.28 on Friday.Maybank Investment Bank Research analyst Yin Shao Yang was the only analyst who upgraded his call on Genting Malaysia from “hold” to “buy” following the sharp decline in the share price. This was prior to the conference call on Friday.Yin says in his report that the current share price implies that the OTP investment has been written off. He adds that Genting Malaysia may even receive the OTP for free with spare change if it wins its US$1 billion claim.“Fox claimed US$46.2 million in accelerated payments but Genting Malaysia intends to claim for its OTP investment of US$750 million and consequential and punitive damages that, in total, will exceed US$1 billion. Although the theme park will no longer be Fox-branded, we understand that its construction will continue and it will eventually operate as an ‘in-house’ OTP. Recall that Genting Malaysia operated its own OTP before closing it in September 2013,” he says.A fund manager who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity tells The Edge that the impact from the Fox World theme park is not as significant as the increase in gaming duties on gross collections to 35%, as well as the increase of the annual casino licence fee by RM30 million to RM150 million and machine dealer’s licence to RM50,000 from RM10,000 a year.“While it is a loss not to have the first Fox-brand theme park in the world in Genting, the impact is not as severe. The theme park is unlikely to be the main revenue contributor to the group, even if it is Fox branded, and the whole idea is to increase visitor arrivals with the opening of the theme park.“So, while there is going to be some negative impact on the group’s earnings, Genting could still run the theme park on its own so it will not be a total loss for the company. And if it wins the case against Fox and Disney, it will get some compensation,” he says, adding that the legal proceedings could take some time but even a potential impairment of US$750 million from the OTP investment does not justify the sharp decline in share price.Genting Malaysia was the second worst performing stock for the week among the FBM KLCI component stocks, behind Telekom Malaysia Bhd, while Genting was the fourth worst performing stock for the week behind Axiata Group Bhd. Genting Malaysia’s share price has fallen 20.3% over the past week, as news of the lawsuit against Fox and Disney emerged, to a six-year low of RM2.84 before recovering somewhat to close at RM2.86 on Friday. Genting’s share price declined 8.9% to close the week at a three-year low of RM6.28.On whether Genting Malaysia’s downward trend has reversed, Hong Leong Investment Bank’s head of retail research Loui Low believes that there is stiff resistance in the range of RM2.90 to and RM3, despite a slight recovery seen on Friday.“There is no sign of a reversal yet as it (technical indicator) is still downward trending for the time being. Despite [being] oversold, it needs to surpass RM3 convincingly before the reversal would start.”As for Genting, he says it is still trending lower with no sign of reversal and the share price may even revisit RM6, followed by the next support at RM5.80.On a more positive note, Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau, tells The Edge that while Genting Malaysia and Genting could still face some downside pressure amid the negative sentiment involving high-profile companies such as Disney and Fox, investors with a longer-term view could look at the opportunities to buy the dip. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fox-and-disneys-sellers-remorse-adds-pressure-genting-malaysia,"2019-05-01 20:06:55"

The cargo represents a value of US$7.82 million.FGV Trading is now claiming against TM Line and GMS Line for misdelivery of the cargo, as they have allegedly discharged and delivered the cargo without the production of original bills of lading, which FGV Trading said to date remains in its possession.As such, FGV said it is claiming the US$7.82 million, reflecting the value of the 11,764 tonnes of the cargo, along with an interest rate of 1.5% per month.FGV said the TM Line arbitration is not expected to have any operational impact on FGV and FGV Trading.But the two companies may see a financial impact if FG Trading fails in its action against GMS Line and TM Line.Shares in FGV fell two sen or 2.53% to 77 sen at today’s close, valuing the group at RM2.81 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fgv-unit-starts-arbitration-proceedings-against-uranus-owner-tm-line,"2019-05-01 20:06:56"

Maintain neutral: There were no major new post- or prepaid headline promotions from September to November but U Mobile Sdn Bhd’s GX50/30 unlimited plans (launched in mid-June) remained on the market. The industry’s mobile revenue for the third quarter of 2018 (3Q18) eased 0.5% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) (-1.2% year-on-year [y-o-y]). Maxis Bhd gained 0.4/1.4 percentage points q-o-q in mobile revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation market share to 38.9%/45.8% at Digi.Com Bhd’s and Celcom’s expense. We have stayed “neutral” on the Malaysian telco sector. 
At Digi’s retail shops, we saw some attractive limited-time offers, likely to counter competitive pressure on the lower-end segment. For now, the market is still largely stable, but we are watching if any of the big three telcos launch low-priced fixed speed unlimited plans.The international direct dialing segment was quiet, as only Maxis made a slight change to its mobile tariff (to Nepal).In reaction to package revisions of Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM)/Maxis and regulatory pressures, TIME dotCom Bhd offered its existing fibre home broadband subscribers for free two to five times of speed upgrades for the same price at end-September. Then, in October, TIME launched revised home fibre broadband plans priced at RM99/RM139 for 100Mbps/500Mbps, 34%/54% lower than before.The mobile industry’s service revenue eased a slight 0.5% q-o-q (-1.2% y-o-y) for 3Q18, after a decent 2Q18. Prepaid revenue resumed its downtrend, -3.1% q-o-q (-7.6% y-o-y). Post-paid revenue rose 2.4% q-o-q (+3.7% y-o-y) on greater net adding. As for the fixed line business, TM’s 3Q18 revenue was stable y-o-y and q-o-q.We have switched our top Malaysian telco pick from Digi to Axiata Group Bhd due to a strong earnings rebound in financial year 2019 forecast and a bigger upside to the share price for the latter. Malaysian telcos are trading at an 11% premium to the Asean average 2019 forecast enterprise value/operating free cash flow of 13.5 times, with decent 2018 to 2019 forecast yields of 3.5% to 3.8%. Downside risks include spectrum auctions for the 700MHz/2,600MHz, with higher-than-expected final prices and more intense competition. An upside risk is value creation from mergers and acquisitions. — CGSCIMB Research, Dec 6",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/telecom-sector-expected-be-stable,"2019-05-01 20:06:57"

410,"December 04, 2018 16:00 pm +08",TM,"New TM chief facing Herculean task ","TELEKOM Malaysia Bhd group chief operating officer Shazril Imri Mokhtar, who resumed the role of acting group CEO on Nov 16 following the resignation of Datuk Bazlan Osman, is the third person to helm the hot seat this year.But with TM’s share price plummeting more than 60% so far this year, Imri — or anyone who fills the top spot — will be faced with the Herculean task of leading the telecommunications company, which is in a tight spot. Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo shows no sign of dialling down criticism of the telco for its high prices and poor customer satisfaction.When reporters asked Gobind at the parliament lobby last week if he would take responsibility for the decline in TM’s share price, the minister stood his ground. “I completely understand that it involves share prices. But at the end of the day, that does not mean a minister or a government official cannot ask any question or say anything.”One of the main concerns that Imri will have to address is the disparity between Unifi and Streamyx pricing in terms of megabits per second (Mbps). The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) has issued a statement saying that TM must rationalise the pricing disparity so that consumers are charged fairly.Recall that the recent reduction of wholesale broadband prices with the enforced Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP) has led to a decline in the price of the Unifi package plan. While this is good for Unifi fibre customers, those who are still on Streamyx have been left out. For example, Streamyx’s 1Mbps plan costs RM110 per month while Unifi’s 100Mbps plan is RM129 per month.In response to The Edge’s questions on how TM, under Imri, will work together with the government, the telco says it will continue to play a major role in fulfilling Malaysians’ digital and communications needs and is in ongoing discussions with the government for a collaborative win-win approach to effectively address the connectivity issues faced by Streamyx customers, once and for all.“In order to do this, TM looks to accelerate discussions with the ministry and the MCMC to explore specific collaborative options, various fit-for-purpose technologies as well as optimising existing industry mechanisms in order to deliver a better broadband experience nationwide,” it adds.According to CIMB Investment Bank research analyst Foong Choong Chen, regulatory pressure remains on TM as the minister is trying to address issues such as Streamyx’s subscribers not being able to enjoy the revised fibre offers due to technical availability.Foong adds that some Home Streamyx subscribers may turn to other service providers or other technology platforms such as LTE (Long-Term Evolution) or LTE-A (Long Term Evolution-Advanced) wireless broadband.“Besides the 340,000 Home Streamyx subscribers that will be migrating to Unifi, we have assumed a churn of 40,000 Home Streamyx subscribers annually to other retail service providers … We have assumed the blended Streamyx ARPU (average revenue per user) stays at RM88 per month from financial year 2019 onwards,” Foong says in a Nov 5 report.In an earlier report, Affin Hwang Investment Bank research analyst Isaac Chow had pointed out the downside risk to Streamyx’s package prices with TM yet to make any reduction given the focus by the minister.Meanwhile, there is concern that the telco could face a more competitive landscape as the government has requested Tenaga Nasional Bhd to consider offering its fibre optic network to telcos to promote competition and choice. In September this year, TNB kick-started a pilot project in Jasin, Melaka, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The project aims to assess the technical, safety and commercial viability of using TNB’s existing infrastructure for internet connectivity.All these are happening at a time when TM is faced with competitive pricing in the fixed broadband space. While it is too early to judge how Imri will perform, one thing is for sure — he will have his work cut out for him. Speculation over Bazlan’s resignationThe market has been talking about the possibility of another round of government-linked company (GLC) shake-ups, and Bazlan’s departure has added fuel to the fire.Recall that following Pakatan Harapan’s victory in the 14th general election, many high-profile leaders at GLCs were replaced. Some of the big names included Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar and Tan Sri Azman Mokhtar. TM’s then managing director and group CEO, Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly, had also resigned from his positions in June due to “personal matter”.An investment head with a local asset management house says the market is speculating that Bazlan’s resignation is part of another round of GLC clean-up. “There is [also] talk of CEOs from two local banks leaving,” he says.It is worth noting that several names have been bandied about as potential candidates to fill the position of TM’s CEO, including Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd CEO Datuk Rohana Rozhan, who will be leaving the pay-TV operator come 2019, and former TM chief strategy officer Dr Farid Mohamed Sani.In response to The Edge’s enquiries on Bazlan’s resignation, TM says he tendered his resignation to “pursue other interests”. It adds that he will be staying until the end of February to facilitate the leadership transition and to ensure continuity.The telco says the appointment of Imri to replace Bazlan is a natural progression, and that the transition will be smooth with Bazlan’s continued guidance. “He (Imri) will be able to effectively execute the strategic initiatives planned to navigate the company through the current challenges and position us in a more resilient, competitive and sustainable footing.” Value emerge for TMMIDF Research head Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman believes TM is inching closer to an oversold position and its valuation — based on its forward enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EV/Ebitda) of 4.5 times — is much lower than some of the other telcos such as DiGi.Com Bhd (11.8 times) and TIME dotCom Bhd (11.0 times).According to him, TM deserves a better valuation considering that it has a larger fibre network than its peers.Is it the right time to buy TM’s shares?“I believe so … because the value is there, particularly for dividend yield hunters,” says Redza. However, he points out that sentiment is a bit negative at the moment with the issue of TM’s package pricing, resignation of senior management and interruption of services.“TM is at the 44th position in terms of market capitalisation size (and this is without imputing other factors such as liquidity and free float). So, talk of its exclusion from the FBM KLCI components, which is highly possible, has also added to the negative sentiment.“If TM is removed (from the FBM KLCI), this will result in further downward pressure on its price movement, although its financial fundamentals will not likely be adversely affected.”On the bright side, Redza says the telco has an advantage with the high speed broadband (HSBB 1 and 2) and sub-urban broadband (SUBB), which will give it a head start over competitors even if the government were to allow more competition.He believes the group could still monetise the available capacity of its fibre networks by selling them to major telcos, despite lagging behind in last-mile connection compared with other mobile players and TIME dotCom.“Despite these challenges, there is still value in the company. Dividend yield is rather attractive at above 5% and any increase in broadband penetration will likely benefit its wholesale business,” says Redza.While it is true that investors with a long-term investment horizon may want to give TM a second look, most analysts who cover the counter feel that it is too early to jump in. Bloomberg data shows that 10 out of 28 analysts have a “sell” call on the stock while another 14 have a “hold” call. Only four have a “buy” call.Affin’s Chow is one of the more pessimistic ones, with a “sell” call and a target price of RM2.25. CIMB’s Foong, meanwhile, has recommended investors to hold on to TM’s shares and has a target price of RM2.50. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/new-tm-chief-facing-herculean-task,"2019-05-01 20:07:05"

417,"December 03, 2018 08:12 am +08",TM,"Bears seen to roll into 2019","KUALA LUMPUR: There seems to be no respite for stock investors from the bearish pressure next year following the disappointing third-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Some notable disappointments in the latest round of earnings came from the gaming sector, with casino operator Genting Malaysia Bhd and its parent Genting Bhd suffering their first quarterly net loss in a decade of RM1.49 billion and RM275.8 million respectively, and that of number forecast operator Magnum Bhd its first quarterly net loss since its 2013 corporate exercise amounting to RM70.51 million.Things were no better for the telecommunications sector, where an impairment loss on its network assets dragged Telekom Malaysia Bhd down to post its first quarterly net loss in a decade, amounting to RM175.59 million.Meanwhile, the volatile commodity price plagued corporates, specifically the slump in crude palm oil (CPO) prices which impacted plantation counters while lower crude oil prices continued to be a bane for the oil and gas sector.Given this scenario, where do investors put their money in 2019? It will boil down to one’s own risk appetite, said Public Investment Bank’s (PublicInvest) head of research Ching Weng Jin.He is of the view that next year is going to be a challenging one, especially for those wishing to seek returns in Bursa Malaysia given the fact that there are still many uncertainties from an external standpoint.“Generally, the Malaysian stock market may start to look cheap, but the uncertainties from external factors such as the US-China trade war and its effect on global trade still persists, and with Malaysia being an open economy, it will not help if the trade war escalates,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.“Commodity prices have also been volatile. With Budget 2019 factored based on an oil price of US$70 (RM292.89) per barrel and given the government’s dependence on oil revenue, oil prices would be monitored quite closely.“So, unless investors can stomach this kind of volatility from an external front, at least in the first half of 2019 (1H19), things are not looking too promising for the Malaysian stock market,” he said.Ching qualifies that the decision to invest in the stock market boils down to investors’ sentiment.“Ultimately, the decision to invest in the market is whether you feel confident or not, so if externally the sentiment is affected, people will not be too gung-ho about the stock market. However, if factors are conducive domestically then people will have reason to buy,” he said.Looking at the FBM KLCI’s performance, MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman opined that the benchmark index is being weighed down by the decline in CPO prices, which have fallen 24% year to date (YTD) to RM1,759 per tonne, coupled with negative news on the gaming and telecommunications sectors.YTD, the KLCI fell 7% to close at 1,679.86 points last Friday.“These factors are likely to continue to affect the KLCI’s movement in the near to medium term,” he added. Silver lining amid gloomThere are some catalysts that may help spur the market next year, according to TA Securities chief investment officer Choo Swee Kwee.“One is the restructuring of government-linked companies (GLCs), both in terms of management and shareholdings in listed corporations. For example, Khazanah Nasional Bhd last week pared down its holdings in IHH Healthcare Bhd and we probably could see a lot more [to come] in 2019 for companies under Khazanah’s stable as well as that of other GLCs, and this is not surprising as the government has said they should lessen their involvement in businesses,” he said.Choo noted that restructuring in the power and telecommunications sectors could also provide some excitement for the stock market.“The private sector could also see some foreign direct investments as a catalyst. One thing that the (US-China) trade war issue has highlighted to businesses is that they cannot just rely on one country for their factory because if anytime the US targets a certain country [on trade disputes], and your factory is there, you end up being caught.“We probably could see some diversification of factories from China and other countries into Malaysia [if the trade war escalates]. Of course, Malaysia is not the only country to consider but it is a possibility due to the weak ringgit, which makes it cheaper for foreign investors.“Bear in mind that Malaysia has [one of] the best infrastructures in place among Southeast Asian countries,” said Choo.Inter-Pacific Asset Management chief executive officer Lim Tze Cheng is of the view that the announcement by the government in Budget 2019 that it will return RM37 billion in goods and services tax and income tax refunds to their rightful owners could be a positive indicator for the stock market in 2019.“The tax refunds to me was the most significant item of Budget 2019. In the past the country had been reporting strong gross domestic product numbers, but the reality on the ground was that [businesses] were not doing well. At least now we have a clear picture of what is happening, meaning that there was RM37 billion that had been taken out of the economic system in the past,” he said.“For a sizeable small to medium enterprise [for example], this could work out to an average of RM2 million in refunds, that had not been returned to them in the past.“So to me the government releasing this RM37 billion back [into the system] is a very positive move as this would go back to businesses and spur their working capital, and the ripple effect of this would be significant, hopefully this generates back some interest in the stock market and spurs the banking and consumer sectors” said Lim.Yesterday, Bloomberg also reported that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to keep their trade war from escalating with a promise to halt the imposition of new tariffs for 90 days as the world’s two largest economies negotiate a lasting agreement.The truce between the US and China emerged after a highly anticipated dinner on Saturday between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Group of Twenty summit in Argentina. The leaders agreed to pause the introduction of new tariffs and intensify their trade talks, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was quoted as saying in the report. Will Bursa ever return to the 1990s era?According to analysts, investors should not expect the local bourse to return to the era in the early 1990s before the 1997 Asian financial crisis hit when the Bursa was a much more vibrant stock market than it is today in terms of investor’s interest.Fortress Capital Asset Management director Geoffrey Ng pointed out that the 1990s was an era where market and investor sophistication was less developed than today.“Retail investors at more than 50% of market participation [then] practised investing behaviour that favoured speculation and short-term price activity of stocks.“With higher institutional activity currently, fundamental investing and more efficient information dissemination mean that stock prices better reflect their true fundamentals,” he said.Brahmal Vasudevan — an active investor on Bursa who holds shares on the local stock exchange in his personal capacity, as well as via private equity firm Creador Sdn Bhd which he founded in 2011 and is chief executive officer — attributes the stock market vibrancy back in the 1990s to strong economic growth in the country which helped spur growth of the listed firms.“Hence our markets were active, [but] this was probably also fuelled by some degree of speculation. As the country matures the total market may not be as exciting but within this there will always be new interesting stories such as Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd and QL Resources Bhd which did exceptionally well in the last three years,” said Brahmal. Where are the bright spots on Bursa?PublicInvest’s Ching sees the banking sector as one of the few bright spots on Bursa next year. Banks recorded a decent performance earnings-wise in 3Q18.“While the banking sector is seen as a proxy to the economy, but as long as there is no major blow up in asset quality, the sector’s earnings will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace,” he said when asked whether the government’s forecast of a slower gross domestic product growth for 2019 could pose a downside risk to the banking sector.“In terms of relative valuations, banks are quite cheap at 11 to 12 times compared with the broader market, which is at 16 to 17 times,” he added Ching.MIDF’s Redza is also upbeat on the banking sector in 2019.“The banking sector is likely to exhibit a decent performance. While there are uncertainties on the geopolitical front, consumer staples and discretionary will also likely see some resilience, hence their still higher price-earnings multiples seen now, [particularly] for the food and beverage and gloves [sectors],” he said.Brahmal said Creador’s modus operandi on investing is to be “secular trend investors”.“Therefore, we focus on sectors with long-term growth stories. We believe that sectors such as value retailing will be a great sector for 2019. Consumers are looking for value for money and companies which are able to address this trend will ultimately do well. One compelling story is a company we have invested in called MR DIY which will likely undertake an initial public offering in late 2019,” he said.Disappointing corporate earnings have not helped valuations of the KLCI, which to a foreign investor is still an expensive buy at 18.5 times price-to-earnings ratio, a 54% premium to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.On the domestic front, things have not been any better.Recall that former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak had announced measures to boost lacklustre retail interest in the stock market in February this year including a six-month waiver of trading and clearing fees for new investors and exemption of stamp duty for three years for small- and mid-cap business.But the FTSE Bursa Malaysia MidS Cap Index, which comprises small and medium companies with a market capitalisation of RM200 million to RM2 billion, has declined by 28% YTD, suggesting that the measures did not really have much of an impact.It now remains to be seen if the new government can succeed in its plan to make Malaysia an “Asian tiger” once again where foreign investments start flowing into the country, and in the same breadth give the stock market a much-needed boost.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bears-seen-roll-2019,"2019-05-01 20:07:10"

Excluding the impairment, normalised profit after tax and minority interests (Patmi) rose 31% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM266.4 million. 
Its revenue added 0.2% y-o-y to RM2.95 billion for 3QFY18 as higher contributions from the Internet (+2% y-o-y) and others (+12% y-o-y) were able to fully offset declines in data (-5% y-o-y) and voice (-5% y-o-y).Due to the impairment, a net loss of RM175.6 million was reported for 3QFY18 against a net profit of RM102 million for 2QFY18, while normalised Patmi rose 71% q-o-q. Quarterly revenue gained 0.3% q-o-q following mixed performances of different segments (Internet: -5%; voice +8%; Data: +8%; and others: -6%).Its 3QFY18 normalised earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin was higher at 32% from 28% for 2QFY18, while the normalised Patmi margin climbed to 9% from 5.3% for the previous quarter.Total broadband subscribers dropped 2.7% y-o-y and 0.7% q-o-q to 2.29 million as unifi subscribers grew 19% y-o-y and 4% q-o-q to 1.26 million but was unable to compensate for declines in Streamyx subscribers which declined 20% y-o-y and 6% q-o-q to 1.03 million.A higher average revenue per user (Arpu): TM’s Arpu for Streamyx broadband was lower at RM87 (versus RM88 for 2QFY18), while Arpu for unifi increased to RM193 versus RM190 for 2QFY18.Cash reserves increased to RM2.2 billion from RM1.6 billion for 2QFY18. As a result, gross debt/Ebitda improved to 2.5 times (from 2.59 times for 2QFY18).TM has reduced its dividend policy of RM700 million or 90% of normalised Patmi, whichever is higher, to 40% to 60% of Patmi depending on the earnings performance, financial conditions, reserve levels and capital commitments.Its 9MFY18 normalised Patmi of RM527.5 million was within expectations after having accounted for 88% of our full-year estimate, while 9MFY18 revenue was also within expectations after achieving 75% of the FY18 forecast.We have kept our revenue and earnings per share forecasts for FY18 and FY19.Due to the reduced dividend policy, we have downgraded the stock to “hold”, with a lower TP of RM2.50 (previously RM3.90) based on FY19 forecast dividend discount model valuation.

Malaysia struck a deal with China to resume the East Coast Rail Link at a lower cost and revived the US$34 billion property and transport hub Bandar Malaysia.“Fiscal stimulus, per resurrection of ECRL and Bandar Malaysia projects, is returning, oil prices are exceeding target and liquidity is ample,” the bank said in the report. “Government policy-centric catalytic news flow alone could allow the KLCI to recover to 12-month highs of 1,850.”Macquarie expects similar developments to happen with MRT 3 and the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail project, as well as in the telecom sector and within the Petroliam Nasional Bhd group of companies.The KLCI is showing some signs of a revival.

The benchmark index has risen by almost 1% this week and market players are hopeful it can be sustained until the first quarter corporate reporting season.“There has been interest in the market over the past few days particularly in the beaten down stocks, especially banks and healthcare, as well as Tenaga Nasional Bhd,” MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman told The Edge Financial Daily over the phone.Mohd Redza said the rebound comes amid receding concerns about a potential cut to the overnight policy rate, which would have hurt bank earnings and dragged the index down as banking stocks account for the largest weightage on the FBM KLCI.He said of the 16 points increase so far this week, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and Public Bank Bhd, have collectively contributed six points.In addition, domestic macroeconomic figures are still showing “great” numbers, he said, pointing in particular to the consumer price index (CPI) which had been in the negative zone for two consecutive months, sparking concerns of a deflation. However, the CPI registered a marginal growth of 0.2% year-on-year in March.Mohd Redza said the CPI had finally breached the positive line, “as expected.”“But we had to halve the full year (CPI) forecast to 1.1%, since RON95 fuel is now stagnant at RM2.08 per litre,” he said.Hong Leong Investment Bank head of retail research Loui Low expects the KLCI rebound to be sustainable as news flow turns positive, coupled with higher crude oil prices.“Basically, we think the technical rebound should be sustainable because there is less negative news out there compared to the positive ones,” he said, pointing to the recent revival of the East Coast Rail Link and Bandar Malaysia mega infrastructure projects following a government review.“That bodes well for the construction related counters in terms of the trading activities at least for the near term. Also, the firmer crude oil prices are lifting sentiment too as well as [providing] more positive bias indicators at this juncture,” he said.What’s even more interesting, he pointed out, is the strength of trading volume which rocketed to 4.7 billion shares on Monday, 3.7 billion shares on Tuesday and 4.4 billion shares yesterday — well above the 2.7 billion average year-to-date until last Friday.“Value traded the last three trading days also went up to an average RM2.8 billion daily from RM2 billion daily between Jan 1 and April 19,” he noted.While Mohd Redza does not expect the increased trading volume to be sustainable, he expects the momentum to be sustained until next month when first quarter corporate earnings are announced.“We don’t expect corporate earnings to be spectacular because we had seen weakness in export numbers, (plus) long festive holidays and shutdowns, which have impacted distributive sales numbers during the quarter,” he said.As a result, GDP is projected to be lower, albeit still above 4%.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/trading-volume-market-improves,"2019-05-01 20:07:17"

(April 22, RM1.49)
Maintain hold with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.50: Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd’s Go Shop sales grew about 30% year-on-year (y-o-y) while advertising expenditure (adex) fell 5% (due to a tax holiday) for the financial year ended Jan 31, 2019 (FY19). Management intends to continue to grow its home-shopping arm and further extend its reach in the local adex market to sustain revenue. The group has allocated more home-shopping slots in various channels other than the three full-fledged Go Shop channels. With only 1.8 million registered users for Go Shop versus Astro’s 5.7 million registered households, we believe this segment has much room to grow, driven by Star Power and Astro’s wide user penetration rate. Separately, citing sources online, TV is deemed as the most powerful adex medium, although digital advertising has been growing exponentially in recent years. Hence, the group is looking to reinvent Malaysia’s adex scene by leveraging its TV and digital data to advocate targeted advertising. We assume 13% and 5% y-o-y increases in FY20 Go Shop and adex revenues respectively. 
The National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan could increase Astro’s chances of bundling with other Internet service providers (ISPs) which will enable the group to monetise its large array of content. Recall that Astro and Tenaga Nasional Bhd on Jan 19 rolled out the bundling of broadband Internet and Family Pack channels for eligible residents in Jasin, Melaka, and management said it is also negotiating with other ISPs. We believe such bundles would limit the downside risk in Astro’s pay-TV segment as we see more NJOI customers upgrading to the new package amid cheaper offerings. We note that the initial consumer response in Jasin has been very encouraging.Albeit often touted as a major threat to Astro, over-the-top (OTT) holds a different proposition, in our view, as Malaysians still spend over 75% of their daily TV viewing on Astro’s vernacular content, and as we are doubtful that OTT platforms such as Netflix and iflix can completely replace satellite/cable TV in the foreseeable future given their limited capacity for live streaming.Piracy remains the main reason for Astro’s dwindling subscription revenue, with at least 29 illegal sites airing World Cup 2018. Positively, it was reported that Malaysia may follow Singapore’s proposal to ban the sale of media streaming boxes which pose a huge threat to the industry. We gather that the government may require ISPs to adopt dynamic ISP blocking in an effort to clamp down on piracy. With Astro often being Malaysia’s limited content buyer for major international events, management is hopeful the government will soon act to support the media sector.After a long delay, it is believed that the shutting down of free-to-air (FTA) TV’s analogue channels will be concluded in June in an effort to improve viewers’ experience. Moving forward, users will need to pay a one-off cost of about RM400 for set-top boxes for digital viewing. While MYTV is the broadcast service provider selected to spearhead the national digital terrestrial television  roll-out, we believe users might opt for Astro’s NJOI, which is also a free satellite-based TV service with more channels available versus FTA TV.FY19 adex dropped 4.8% y-o-y, while content cost increased 11.7% y-o-y owing to the second quarter of FY19’s (2QFY19) benign performance on the back of the World Cup and a tax holiday which lowered advertising activities. Positively, FY20 adex is expected to increase 5% with content cost normalising to 35% of TV revenue amid the absence of any sporting event and resumption of the tax regime. While financing cost would remain high as the weak ringgit has lifted the mark-to-market revaluation of the M3B transponder’s lease liability, Astro has started hedging 40% of its M3B transponder lease liabilities for the first time in 4QFY19. Note that the lease liabilities for M3B (satellite)(which contains 18 transponders) are still incurred in US dollars, while that for the M3 and M3A have been converted into ringgit.Astro is streamlining its operating costs (content, marketing and distribution, administrative and maintenance) through various cost rationalisation efforts, and it started to reap benefits in 3QFY19. We gather that the voluntary separation scheme exercise that was finalised in February would contribute net pre-tax savings of RM400 million a year starting FY20. Moreover, Astro has been actively renegotiating its content cost with key content providers due to the proliferation of piracy which has caused an array of content losing its exclusivity.We expect FY20 core net profit to rise 12% y-o-y on the back of normalisation of adex and content costs. Various cost rationalisation efforts will offset the structurally weak pay-TV demand. We also introduce our FY22 net profit forecasts. We maintain “hold” and our TP of RM1.50, implying 12.9 times FY21 forecast price-earnings ratio and 6.8 times enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, with an attractive dividend yield of 7.7%.

434,"April 20, 2019 15:30 pm +08",TENAGA,"Cutting Edge: Thrilling, disruptive and game-changing","When Kamarul Muhamed decided to ditch his comfortable and well-paying accounting job almost two decades ago because it was too vanilla, he knew he was taking a huge risk. But he had to do it because he wanted to do something thrilling, disruptive and game-changing.It was definitely a risk worth taking. In 2014, Kamarul established Aerodyne, a drone-as-a-service (DAAS) company, with seed capital of just RM1 million. The business took off at an unprecedented rate and today, it has a presence in more than 20 countries, including Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, the UK and Saudi Arabia.With hard work and determination, Kamarul has managed to grow the company’s order book to more than RM400 million. And he is not stopping there. He wants Aerodyne to be Malaysia’s first tech unicorn by 2021 and plans to list the company the following year.“I know it is a tall order because there are currently no tech unicorns in the country. But we felt very strongly that we could achieve it, given our present growth rate,” says Kamarul.The company recently made the headlines because it was showcasing a prototype of a drone-concept vehicle — Vector — at the Langkawi InternationalMaritime and Aerospace Exhibition that was mistaken by some individuals for a flying car, giving rise to much hilarity, memes and misplaced wit. Kamarul was quick to point out that Vector was actually a drone-concept vehicle designed for carrying passengers, cargo delivery and surveillance purposes.When Aerodyne was founded, the drones were not used for their current purpose. Back in the mid-2000s, Kamarul had another company called DKM2, which was a full-fledged production house. The company had an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) division, which used drones to capture visuals for documentaries.“At the time, we were probably one of the pioneer production houses in Malaysia using drones for certain shots. After a long time, we thought about diversifying our business. Back then, our business was fun and profitable but we could not scale,” says Kamarul.“At the same time, we knew that drone technology had matured. So, we decided to shift our focus from visual to data. We turned our UAV division into a separate entity, pumped in seed capital and started Aerodyne.”The first year was slow. The team spent most of their time and resources on R&D. They had the end game — being an enterprise-level solution provider — in mind, but they were still figuring out how to make it work.Three months in, Malaysia’s east coast was hit by a devastating flood. Kamarul and his team got to work almost immediately, using the company’s drones to capture information and footage that could be shared with the public, government agencies and mainstream media at no cost. This propelled the company into the limelight. It received acknowledgment from various parties, including the Department of Civil Aviation.That experience taught the team that data is definitely the way to go. So, Aerodyne started offering its first commercial product — a project management and reporting solution for construction and property development companies called PRISM. Aiming at solving problems in construction such as delays and non-compliance, the business soared.“We developed PRISM from scratch. From day one, we established that we wanted an analytics-based solution. So, it was all about capturing data. Today, we have handled more than 50 domestic projects with a gross development value of RM80 billion,” says Kamarul.“These projects include Menara Warisan Merdeka and the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development project in Pengerang. Because we have all these long-term contracts, we are enjoying a nice cash flow every month. It is hard to believe that we started with only RM1 million.” Cost-saving solutionGradually, the Aerodyne team realised they had a bigger role to play — helping enterprises with their digital transformation. They began developing Verticality, an artificial intelligence-equipped asset management solution that could help large enterprises save about 20% of the cost of maintaining their assets.“Assets such as wind turbines. There are about 400,000 wind turbines globally,” says Kamarul.“Small turbines generate revenue of about US$400 per hour. Typically, operators need to shut them down for up to two days to inspect the blades, which leads to massive loss of opportunity. However, drones only take an hour to do this. With our technology, operators can repair their assets before problems arise, hence saving them a lot of money.”This is a new market focus for Aerodyne, following its 60% acquisition of AtSite, a Danish forerunner in wind turbine blade inspections for the wind turbine generation industry in Europe. Verticality can also be used in other industries such as telecommunications and infrastructure development, says Kamarul.In Malaysia, Aerodyne’s main client is edotco Group Sdn Bhd, an integrated telecommunications infrastructure services company, which owns about 29,000towers in the region. edotco is harnessing the company’s aerial capabilities to boost efficiency in its daily operations. This includes infrastructure site audits, routine preventive maintenance surveys, network assessments and monitoring for revenue assurance.“Traditionally, it would take more than a day to inspect a tower and another two months to churn out the report. Our drone takes an hour and the report is almost instantaneous,” says Kamarul.The company is also paying more attention to precision farming, that is, using technology to measure and manage variabilities such as yield, soil, pests and weeds across the fields to enhance efficiency and achieve optimum productivity, product quality and economic returns.“To do this, we use drones with multispectral sensors. The visible spectrum consists of only seven bands of colours. But there are actually hundreds of other bands that we cannot see with the naked eye, including ultraviolet and infrared. These invisible bands are actually very useful in determining the crop’s health,” says Kamarul.“Our advanced analysis can even help with disease prevention. For example, we can detect Ganoderma — which is known as cancer for plants — at a very early stage. So, farmers can commence early treatment to optimise their yield.”According to Aerodyne executive director Azita Azizan, the drones can conduct Normalised Difference Vegetation Index analysis, which is able to deduce which fields need more fertiliser and which need less. “We capture all this data and then let one of our agronomists analyse it to come up with actionable suggestions and plans. So, our clients do not have to spend more to employ a data scientist. We take care of everything for them.”Big enterprises such as developers and telecommunications tower owners may not mind paying for such services. But can the same be said about agriculture companies?Azita says it only takes some convincing as most companies appreciate the savings that come with the solution. For instance, fertilisers are expensive. If fertilisers are distributed optimally, the companies stand to save up to 20% per month, she points out.Kamarul is currently working out a profit-sharing scheme. “I know how much our clients are making a year. So, I can propose a profit-sharing scheme to help them gain 30% to 50% more profit. It will pay for my service and we will split the returns. Of course, I need to do this with full transparency. So, it is a work in progress,” he says.Most importantly, Aerodyne is able to offer automation — something very valuable in this day and age. “In powerline inspection, for example, we use thermal cameras to look at the temperature of the assets. High temperatures may mean the equipment is failing,” says Azita.“We capture more than 6,000 thermal data points per day. It would take an entire year for one person to process this data. So, companies would need to employ an entire team to do this. Whereas our algorithm automatically processes this data and does predictive analysis. We can deliver the report within a day.”The company hires subject-matter experts such as telecommunications engineers and remote-sensing experts to assist with solutions development, she says. “In fact, about 80% of the company’s employees are subject-matter experts.” Further expansionAerodyne is always looking to expand into new markets. Kamarul says that at any given time, there is at least one team dispatched to do proofs of concept for potential clients in markets such as Chile and Japan. He himself typically spends only a week in Malaysia each month. Most of the time, he is either attending events or meeting potential clients.“It is hard to believe that we only started looking at markets beyond Malaysia in March last year. Our first foreign market was Australia. We were surprised by the tremendous response. There are a lot of drone players over there, but our service is faster, cheaper and better,” says Kamarul.He truly believes that the “faster, cheaper and better” mantra is what sets the company apart from other DAAS players. “Recently, we were at a commercial UAV event in London and I met the CEO of a company about to close an asset management tender. He was surprised to learn about our solution and what was supposed to be a 15-minute conversation became a two-hourdiscussion. He called his tender committee and asked them to delay the tender awarding process because he wanted to give us a chance,” he says.Aerodyne was ranked No 7 out of the 200 global drone-operating service providers by Drone Industry Insights. And the CEO had already spoken to two of the higher ranked companies, but they were not delivering what he wanted.Since Aerodyne works with large enterprises, it is not always plain sailing, says Azita. “There is a lot of red tape, people to convince and stuff they need to take care of before they can migrate to our solution. TenagaNasional Bhd, for example, already had a team of contractors manually doing its asset management. Sometimes, companies cannot even confirm that they want to use our services after a year. We just have to be patient.”Aerodyne was self-funded for the first three years. This year, Kamarul realised that the company would need to make a quantum leap to invest more in R&D and expand more aggressively around the world. So, it completed its Series A round of funding with Axiata Digital Innovation Fund last month.He says Aerodyne could even go for an initial public offering if it wanted to, but he prefers to wait. “We want to get a better valuation before we make that big move.”",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cutting-edge-thrilling-disruptive-and-gamechanging,"2019-05-01 20:07:21"

The total amount raised in IPOs also plunged 91% to RM633.12 million — the lowest in 20 years — compared with 2017’s RM7.38 billion.Astramina Advisory Sdn Bhd managing director Wong Muh Rong says investors are still uncertain about Malaysia’s policies and ministers publicly airing their differences do not help matters.She cited the recent outburst involving Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Redzuan Md Yusof’s rebuke of his colleague Yeo Bee Yin, the minister of energy, science, technology, environment and climate change, over rare earths mining company Lynas Corp Ltd.“These sort of matters should be addressed in-house at Cabinet meetings,” Wong observes.An investment banker points out that companies are holding back on IPOs as they are afraid that they will not get the valuations they desire. “Bursa has been one of the worse performers in Asia year to date.”YTD, the FBM KLCI has fallen 2.9% to close at 1,641.81 points last Friday.Nevertheless, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s remarks at the two-day Invest Malaysia conference last month, suggesting Putrajaya could be looking to list mature government-linked entities, have stirred up some interest in the IPO market.“If you want to excite the IPO market [with the listing of government-linked companies], let’s do a really good one. We must pick something that Malaysia is good at, and Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is one of them,” says Astramina’s Wong.“Petronas is already run like an international public listed company, so it will have little trouble finding investors and proving its value,” she adds.Three of its units — Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and Petronas Dagangan Bhd — are already listed on Bursa, with their market capitalisation at RM72.8 billion, RM34.67 billion and RM24.84 billion respectively.However, a head of a local investment bank is sceptical of a public share sale of Petronas as the national oil company is considered a strategic asset to the government.Pointing to plans for the domestic and international listing of Saudi oil giant Aramco as well as China’s Sinopec Marketing Co, a subsidiary of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, Wong opines that a divestment of even a 30% to 40% stake would be sufficient to excite the IPO market.“The listing [of Petronas] may not be this year, but they can start working on the documentation for the IPO and then launch it once market conditions improve.”Wong expects more mergers and acquisitions and restructuring activities this year, but stresses, “We still need to see more progress in reform efforts by the [Pakatan Harapan-led] government after one year.”Investors are also keenly watching QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd’s IPO, which is set to be the country’s biggest listing since that of integrated petrochemical producer Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd, which raised RM4 billion in July 2017.QSR’s largest shareholder, Johor Corp, is seeking to raise as much as RM2 billion from the IPO, which could value the company at some RM6 billion.Johor Corp president and CEO Datuk Kamaruzzaman Abu Kassim said last May that private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) were looking to exit the fast-food operator.Initially slated for the first half of the year, the IPO may face further delays as its shareholders want higher valuations, a source close to the deal tells The Edge. The desire for richer valuations is telling, considering that QSR’s IPO has been planned since 2016.Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) data shows that QSR’s net profit grew 4.7% to RM192.59 million in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018), from RM183.95 million in FY2017. Revenue rose a marginal 1% to RM4.61 billion from RM4.56 billion in FY2017.According to investment bankers, the potential listing of other government-linked entities include Malayan Banking Bhd’s (Maybank) insurance arm Etiqa International Holdings Sdn Bhd (EIH), Axiata Group Bhd’s 62.37%-owned unit edotco Group Sdn Bhd, highway concessionaire Projek Lintasan Kota Holdings Sdn Bhd (Prolintas), Felcra Bhd and the Airport Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).It is understood that Maybank has started making preparations for a possible IPO of Etiqa, including seeking Bank Negara Malaysia’s approval.Maybank’s stake in Etiqa is parked under wholly-owned EIH, which has a 69.05% stake in Maybank Ageas Holdings Bhd, while Brussels-based insurer Ageas NV holds the remaining equity interest.A listing of Etiqa would certainly appeal to the market given its relative size and pedigree. Although EIH’s net profit fell 9% year on year to RM700.84 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, net interest income rose 6.4% y-o-y to RM1.16 billion last year.In an April report last year, CIMB Research pegged Etiqa’s market capitalisation upon listing at between RM5.3 billion and RM10.7 billion, based on a price-to-book value (P/BV) of 1.4 times to 2.8 times. It used Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd’s P/BV as a benchmark.Rumours of Maybank preparing to spin off and list Etiqa have been doing the rounds since 2016, however.At present, Etiqa is the clear leader in the general takaful segment with a market share of more than 50%. It ranks No 3 on the family takaful list, with a market share of 15%.“If you’re launching an IPO, you need to ensure that the company is market ready and the listing optimises the valuation for its shareholders,” says a senior director with a local investment bank, who declined to be named.“But there is liquidity on the side and investors are willing to pay for better assets. Personally, I’m thinking that more immediate [ones] could be things like the possible restructuring of Malaysia Airlines Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd because recent large-cap IPOs have disappointed.“I think the only one that possibly has the most traction could be the Airport REIT,” the senior director adds.Under Budget 2019, the government, being the asset owner of almost all commercial airports in Malaysia, had proposed to set up the world’s first Airport REIT. It had set a target of raising RM4 billion by selling a 30% stake in the REIT to private investment institutions.However, last November, the Malaysian Aviation Commission pointed out that the Airport REIT exercise will only be carried out after the regulated asset base framework and the user fee structure have been negotiated and finalised between the government and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd. That is slated to be completed this year.The idea to list Prolintas was first mooted in March 2017 by then Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) group chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, who had set an end-2018 to early 2019 target.However, investment bankers say a flotation of Prolintas, wholly owned by PNB, is unlikely to take place this year as the government needs to sort out its privatisation policy for highway tolls first.Based on SSM data, the highway concessionaire has been posting losses for the past five years, which widened to RM100.1 million in FY2017 compared with RM31.38 million in FY2016. Revenue, however, rose 58% y-o-y to RM317.41 million in FY2017.Thus, most investment bankers are of the view that the IPOs coming to market this year will be heavily geared towards private companies rather than government-linked entities. Big IPOs on the horizon are family-owned poultry group Leong Hup International Bhd and MR.DIY, the country’s biggest home improvement retailer.According to news reports, Leong Hup is looking to raise as much as US$600 million (RM2.49 billion) and MR.DIY, RM1.5 billion.Leong Hup posted a 7.5% y-o-y fall in net profit to RM247.41 million in FY2017, on a 4.6% rise in revenue to RM5.5 billion. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ipos-private-companies-drive-market-rebound-year,"2019-05-01 20:07:26"

Upgrade to trading buy with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM14.12. Bloomberg reported that Khazanah Nasional Bhd has sold 85 million shares in Tenaga Nasional (TNB) at RM12.33 per share. 
Following this, TNB’s share price fell by as much as 6% last Thursday, before settling at -4%. Year to date (YTD), it has contracted by 21.2%, largely due to lower rate of return on regulated asset base (RAB) of 7.3% set in the second regulatory period (2018-2020), compared with 7.5% in the first regulatory period (2015-2017).While the incentive-based regulation (IBR) framework would cap the return on TNB’s regulated assets, we believe its profitability could still be improved through cost efficiency and higher return on its non-regulated assets (NRA). We are maintaining our earnings forecasts with an unchanged discounted cash flow-based TP of RM14.12. Although Thursday’s sentiment was dragged by news of Khazanah’s disposal, TNB’s fundamentals remain unaffected and hence, we see the weakness in share price as a good opportunity to accumulate.Our TP implies an upside potential of 17% and therefore, we upgrade our call from “neutral” to “trading buy”. Also note that at current market price, TNB’s dividend yield of 4% looks attractive.TNB announced that Khazanah has disposed of 85 million of shares last Thursday. This accounted for only a 1.5% stake in TNB, resulting in Khazanah’s shareholding falling to 27.27%, from 28.76% previously. Khazanah remains the single-largest shareholder of TNB.According to Bloomberg, the disposal of shares by Khazanah was worth about RM1 billion at a price of RM12.33 per share. This represents a 2% discount to its last closing price of RM12.58. Although we believe the disposal is part of asset value realisation by Khazanah, TNB remains a strategic holding of the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.The share price has contracted by 21.2% YTD, largely due to lower rate of return on RAB of 7.3%. Given that TNB’s market capitalisation has declined by RM18.5 billion or 21.2% YTD, compared to a loss in revenue of about RM640 million in financial year 2018 (FY18), we feel the selldown is over-rated.Under the IBR framework, any price adjustment on fuel and generation costs from the parameters set on its base tariff will be passed on to consumers under imbalance cost pass-through mechanism for every six months. For the upcoming review in June 2019, we believe there is less pressure to hike the base tariff on residential customers due to the falling coal prices.In any case, we believe there is still remaining funds available (we estimate the savings are close to RM1 billion, after including the excess revenue collected from FY18) in the Kumpulan Wang Industri Elektrik to be used to subsidise any residential customer surcharge. — PublicInvest Research, April 12",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/higher-profit-seen-tnb-cost-efficiency-better-nra-return,"2019-05-01 20:07:28"
444,"April 15, 2019 08:46 am +08",TENAGA,"More to the sell-off in TNB than just Khazanah’s divestment","KUALA LUMPUR: Was the sell-off in Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (TNB) shares last week overdone?The heavyweight blue chip slid to a three-year low last Thursday after its largest shareholder Khazanah Nasional Bhd placed out 85 million shares in the company at below market price.The 1.5% stake was sold at RM12.33 per share, or RM1.05 billion in total, which was at a 2% or 25 sen discount to the closing price of RM12.58 the day before. Khazanah still owns 27.27% of TNB after the placement.Share placements at a discounted price are not rare, especially for such a high-value transaction. Still, it did not go down well with the market. TNB’s share price lost ground, and the blue chip sank below the placement price once the news broke.The utility stock plunged 5.09% to its intraday low of RM11.94 last Thursday. The sharp fall dragged down the FBM KLCI to a more than two-year low that day.Noting that a discount is normal for such a sizeable share placement, some analysts said the discounted price does not necessarily reflect the fair valuation of the company.A local fund manager said the news might have given a good excuse to short-sell the utility stock, which may explain the temporary selldown.Indeed, TNB’s share price rebounded to RM12.28, it was the third-biggest gainer, in terms of value, on Bursa Malaysia last Friday. Still, the share price is lower than Khazanah’s placement price.All said, it is worth noting that TNB’s share price has been on the decline since October (the month when it released the third-quarter earnings), after it bounced back from the post-14th general election selldown across the board.Khazanah’s rationale for the placement aside, the wide disparity in the utility group’s valuations among analysts reflects the cautious sentiment.Some investment analysts have pegged the target price (TP) lower since the release of its annual earnings for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18) compared with six months ago. The lowest fair value is at RM10.70 while the highest is at RM16. The average TP among 20 analysts is at RM13.05. Year to date, the counter has retreated by 9.71% compared with a 3.57% decline in the KLCI.TNB’s lower returns under the 2018-2020 Regulatory Period (RP2), such as revenue cap policy and lower internal rate of return of 7.3% from 7.5% in RP1 2014-2017, are expected to have already been factored in.So what is the other concern, apart from share overhang as Khazanah may sell down more eventually? Industry reforms that may finally take place.In an interview with The Edge Malaysia weekly last year, Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change Minister Yeo Bee Yin, who has cancelled several power plant projects that were awarded through direct negotiation, commented that there should be more competition in the power sector, in which TNB practically holds a monopoly in both the transmission and distribution segments.“With the reactivation of the Malaysia Programme Office for Power Electricity Reform (MyPower) for the next three years to bring more competition into the utilities market, regulatory risk for TNB has heightened due to increasing uncertainty for its role in the sector,” said RHB Research analyst Lim Sin Kiat.The government, Lim said, could implement changes to the single buyer generation mechanism, power distribution, and a potential reduction in return on regulated assets (after 2020).“Nevertheless, we believe regulatory changes will reduce TNB’s role in the long run, whereby most of the areas currently controlled by the group [especially transmission and distribution] could be opened up to third parties — this would subsequently reduce TNB’s return on assets,” he commented.Yeo expects to share more details on a reform “that will give an implication in many, many years to come” by mid-2019.Should the government stick to its time frame and plan, the reforms in the power industry could happen in a matter of months. And that will be the one challenging task that the newly appointed chief executive officer Amir Hamzah Azizan, who takes over the baton from Datuk Seri Azman Mohd, has to face.If the transmission and distribution segments are opened up for competition, some quarters are of the view that this may lead to breaking up TNB, including listing of certain assets.TNB is also the single buyer for all electricity generated in the country.However, concerns over the impact of an industry reform “appear overly pessimistic and possibly misplaced”, Maybank IB Research analyst Tan Chi Wei said in a note dated April 5.In the note, Tan reiterated its “buy” call with unchanged TP of RM15.50 for TNB.“A commonly mooted reform is the possible introduction of retail competition, which would allow third parties into the ‘customer services’ segment.“The net operating profit after tax attributable to this segment is a mere RM20 million annually,” the analyst said. This is small compared with TNB’s FY18 core net profit of RM5.42 billion.“Another frequently mentioned reform is the possible migration towards a full ‘merchant market’ in the generation space where generators bid to produce electricity, thus theoretically driving down tariffs and lowering generation returns.“Technicalities aside, current generation returns (in-built into capacity payments) are effectively guaranteed upon fulfilment of availability (not generation) targets under the existing power purchase agreement (PPA) framework.“A premature dismantling of the PPA framework would require hefty compensation by the government,” Tan explained.As for the possibility of farming out of TNB’s distribution assets to third parties, Tan suggested that such action will require shareholders’ approval, in any case.Any risk to TNB’s long-term earnings stability will not bode well for the utility stock. While its overseas expansion plan and venture into renewable energy have yet to form a significant part of the group’s portfolio, the regulatory risks will probably be the focal point in the near future, at least.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/more-selloff-tnb-just-khazanahs-divestment,"2019-05-01 20:07:28"
445,"April 14, 2019 14:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Lipper Fund Awards from Refinitiv: On the road to recovery","After a tumultuous 2018, local fund managers are relieved that the headwinds that impacted the financial markets are beginning to settle. Despite the slower-than-expected global growth and uncertainties due to geopolitical tensions, the outlook for 2019 is turning out to be much brighter, they tell Personal Wealth.For one, many events last year that caused uncertainty among investors have created some sweet spots. Asian equities and bonds are starting to look attractive following the sell-off in emerging markets.“Last year started on a wave of optimism over prospects of a synchronised global growth. Instead, it turned out to be one of divergent trends and increased geopolitical and economic uncertainty, which weighed heavily on financial markets,” says Jason Chong, CEO of Manulife Asset Management Services Bhd.“We believe that the many economic difficulties experienced last year are likely to be less problematic in 2019. The gradual progress in trade negotiations between China and the US is a hopeful sign.”The ongoing US-China trade tensions have dominated headlines over the past year, setting off a chain reaction in financial markets across the world. The World Bank predicts that global economic growth is expected to slow down a notch to 2.9% this year from 3% last year.However, as the US and China have shown that they are willing to negotiate to ease trade tensions, the difficulties experienced last year are less likely to exert serious downward pressure on stock markets, says Chong.Apart from the trade tiff, the world’s interest in Brexit has waned considerably as the UK’s negotiations with the EU drag on. Without a firm exit plan, it is anticipated that the UK will be the one to bear the brunt of the fallout.“We see economic growth in major regions re-converge at moderately lower levels, making the continuation of that growth more sustainable. Moderate, better balanced global growth will reduce concerns about inflation and interest rates, which will put less pressure on bond markets,” says Chong.While the negative effects of the trade tensions and other geopolitical events have not entirely passed and could still impact export-reliant Malaysia,  a number of favourable factors are expected to cushion the blows on the local equity and bond markets going forward, he says. “We are seeing fewer political events on a global level that could negatively impact the local market. The US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike [pause] is certainly a welcome move.“Regionally and domestically, equity valuations have become more favourable as they are now below their historical mean and slightly above previous recession levels. We do not expect a meltdown like in the past, given the stronger fundamentals and enhanced quality of companies.“In addition, markets tend to react positively over the long term to newly elected leaders and we expect the same for Malaysia if the new government continues to deliver on its promises.”The 14th general election last year ended the ruling Barisan Nasional’s six-decade-long hold on the country and saw the Pakatan Harapan alliance take control of the federal government.From an equities perspective, Chong expects Malaysia to reap the benefits of certain global and domestic political actions. This could be a longer-term play as the country is increasingly being touted as an alternative base for US firms looking to move their supply chain away from China.“Domestically, the government’s planned restructuring of certain industries, such as the automotive, power, property, telecommunications, gaming, alcohol and tobacco sectors, coupled with its move towards Industry 4.0, could bring about interesting opportunities in these sectors,” says Chong. Regional equities to make a comebackPublic Mutual Bhd CEO Yeoh Kim Hong echoes Chong’s sentiment on equity markets. She says the markets are expected to perform better after the synchronised downturn last year. Most of them have already recovered from the severe battering they received, she points out.After previously spooking markets, the Fed decided to soften its approach to interest rates last month. The US central bank announced that the key interest rate was expected to hover near 2.4% until end-2019. This was three months after it said two hikes could be expected this year. The key interest rate is expected to reach 2.6% in 2020 and remain at that level until 2021, unless economic conditions in the US change significantly.“The Fed’s rate hikes in 2018 caused the US dollar to strengthen against regional currencies and foreign funds to withdraw from developing markets, which caused stock markets across the region to decline. However, with the recent change in its stance on interest rates, developing markets could see a return of fund flows, currency strength and upward rerating of valuations,” says Yeoh.“The less hawkish comments the Fed on interest rates as well as the progress in the US-China trade talks, with the extension of the 90-day trade truce from the March 1 deadline, are positive for market sentiment. A positive outcome of the trade talks and the US keeping interest rates stable or close to neutral will underpin market sentiment going forward.“As we could be near the end of the tightening interest rate upcycle in the US, the pressure on developing-market currencies is easing. This should result in better performances developing-market equities and bonds.”Yeoh says the valuations of US stocks are no longer as excessive and offer a dividend yield of about 2%. “There is room for positive rerating for regional markets such as China and Taiwan, which are currently trading at discounts of 9% and 6% to their historical long-term average price-earnings ratios, with dividend yields of about 4% respectively.”Hong Leong Asset Management Bhd CEO Hoo See Kheng too expects Asian equity markets to outperform, given that valuations have become cheap following last year’s sell-off. “Although growth is expected to be slower than last year’s, we expect corporate earnings growth in Asia to outpace that of developed markets.“In Asean, we favour Malaysia as most of the other countries [such as Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines] are expected to hold their general elections this year and the political uncertainty may be an overhang on these markets, whereas Malaysia emerged from its own general election last year.”But the wave of optimism is not an indication that the global markets are out of the woods. Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd deputy managing director and chief investment officer David Ng sees two risks that the market seems to be complacent about.“First is the ongoing decline of US dollar liquidity as the Fed embarks on quantitative tightening. A decline in US dollar liquidity often leads to weaker US stock markets. And a sharp decline in US stock markets could reverberate regionally and drag down the other stock indices globally,” he warns.The second risk is taking for granted that the US central bank will not raise interest rates this year. Ng reminds investors that although the Fed is holding back on rate hikes for the time being, the world’s largest economy is doing well and its inflation rate could go up.“The market is now pricing in a pause in rate hikes for the rest of 2019. In our view, the US economy remains healthy and inflation could gradually rise. Thus, there is a fair chance that the Fed may resume rate hikes in the second half of this year. This may surprise the market and lead to pullbacks in the bond and equity markets,” he says. Malaysia’s steady growthOn the home front, economic growth is projected to be 4.5% in 2019 amid sustained domestic demand.Yeoh says that after the net outflow of RM11.6 billion from Bursa Malaysia last year, selling pressure from foreign investors is expected to ease. Thus, the local stock market may be positioned to trend higher if foreign markets continue to strengthen.“Valuations of [stocks on Bursa] are slightly higher than their 10-year average, with an average dividend yield of about 3.4%, which should underpin the market amid a stable interest rate outlook,” she says.The ringgit, which depreciated 2.1% to 4.13 against the US dollar last year, has improved to 4.08. Yeoh believes that the local currency will continue to be supported Malaysia’s current account surplus, the recovery in crude oil prices and return of foreign investments. “Following the ringgit’s recovery, investors have taken profit on export-oriented counters, which previously benefited from a weaker ringgit,” she says.But there is renewed interest in sectors that were impacted the weak local currency such as the automotive industry, says Yeoh. The government’s initiative to boost the local currency and the economy is expected to improve credit ratings and lead to a firmer ringgit, she adds.TA Investment Management Bhd CEO Wong Mien says the ringgit is bound to recover over the medium term. “As the new government is trying hard to restore the fiscal health of the country, we believe the ringgit could strengthen in the medium term. As the administration  is trying to reduce the budget deficit and start paying off its debts, we believe foreign investors will return to Malaysia.”Libra Invest Bhd fund manager Joy-Marina Choong Wai Kwin concurs, saying that the local economy is expected to grow steadily. Nevertheless, it may still face uncertainties, she warns, citing Bank Negara Malaysia’s concerns about downside risk as a result of the unresolved US-China trade negotiations.Domestic growth is still vulnerable to external factors such as crude oil prices, a strengthening US dollar, US interest rates and other geopolitical issues, says Choong.Given the current market conditions, Affin Hwang’s Ng warns investors of more turbulence ahead. “Reassess your risk profile and take the current market rebound to rethink your asset allocation. For example, if you find that you have too much exposure to equities when your risk tolerance is low or modest, it is prudent to reallocate a certain portion to lower-risk asset classes such as a bond or dividend fund. Stick to an asset allocation that matches your risk tolerance and stay diversified.”  Bullish on bondsLocal bonds are looking attractive as Bank Negara Malaysia appears to be holding back on raising interest rates for now. This comes as the US Federal Reserve signals that it is done with rate hikes for now, which gives other central banks the flexibility to pause their rate increases or ease policy rates.In the light of this, fund managers believe that Malaysian bonds are expected to do well as Bank Negara is under no compulsion to adjust its overnight policy rate (OPR). Libra Invest Bhd fund manager Joy-Marina Choong Wai Kwin says headline inflation is expected to stay low in the immediate term and remain broadly stable compared with last year.Given the expectations of moderate domestic growth amid benign inflation, there is no urgency for the central bank to raise interest rates in the near term. This is conducive for bond investments, says Choong. “We will continue to actively manage our fixed-income funds while maintaining focus on liquid, high-grade bond issuers with strong credit and stable long-term cash flow.”She recommends that investors look at Malaysian bond funds as domestic growth and inflation are expected to remain moderate. “The slower pace of new primary issuances in the local corporate bond market, especially in the AAA and AA-rated space, may continue to drive yields lower [and prices higher]. While financial markets may experience fluctuations from time to time, we always advocate that investors take a long-term approach towards their investments.“For the local bond market, given the challenging economic landscape, we continue to be overweight on sectors that are resilient to economic cycles — for example, the power sector. [This is mainly] due to its long-term, stable and predictable cash flow, the steady demand for electricity and the strong credit profile of the electricity off-taker — in this case, Tenaga Nasional Bhd.”Manulife Asset Management Services Bhd CEO Jason Chong believes that the risk-reward ratios in the local bond market are quite balanced in the medium term and corporate bonds could be the key driver of returns for fixed-income investors. “The Malaysian bond market is well supported ample domestic liquidity and real money demand. Coupled with expectations of more subdued economic growth and a benign inflation outlook, the OPR could remain unchanged in the early part of this year. We believe this presents an environment that is conducive for investing in bonds,” he says.However, the outlook for Malaysia’s long-term fiscal health remains a concern. The new government’s targets for the country’s fiscal deficit imply that there will be a longer timeline for fiscal consolidation efforts.This affects investor sentiment, says Chong. “In addition, potentially higher net supply of government bonds in the first half of this year may pose a slight drag to the market [although this could ease in the second half of the year as bond maturity increases]. On top of that, Malaysia’s higher reliance on oil-related revenue increases its vulnerability to global oil price movements, which could hinder the local bond market.“Against this backdrop, we see the market environment as neutral. We believe corporate bonds will remain an attractive asset class that offers higher returns with lower volatility. We expect credit spreads to remain tight as investors continue to chase yields amid the smaller supply of corporate bonds this year.”",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lipper-fund-awards-refinitiv-road-recovery,"2019-05-01 20:07:29"

These were the first wins for the Libra BondEXTRA fund, which was launched in 2002.The fund invests in ringgit-denominated bonds, with a focus on corporate bond issuers with strong financial metrics.Fund manager Joy-Marina Choong Wai Kwin credits the success to an active portfolio management strategy, as opposed to a buy-and-hold approach. According to her, the fixed-income team constantly monitors global economic data, capital flows and movements in the equity, fixed-income and currency markets to anticipate future market directions.“For individual bond selection, we place a strong emphasis on the credit strength of bond issuers, [including factors] such as consistent and visible cash flow, stringent bond structure and good corporate governance. We seek to diversify our investments across sectors and individual securities to mitigate the risk profile of the fund,” says Choong.One of the most challenging situations the team faced in the last few years was when Bank Negara Malaysia restricted transactions in the offshore ringgit non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets at end-2016. The central bank governor said at the time that activities in the ringgit NDF market had negatively impacted the onshore market. This decision resulted in a decline of offshore holdings in Malaysian Government Securities (MGS).“It subsequently dampened investor sentiment and resulted in a decline in trading volumes in the MGS and corporate bond markets. Nonetheless, the sentiment improved after Bank Negara announced a number of initiatives to improve liquidity in the domestic bond market in mid-2017, which included additional hedging flexibility for registered investors,” says Choong.The team weathered this period by managing the fund actively. It focused on liquid, high-grade bonds with strong credit and stable long-term cash flow since buying interest for such bonds remained strong, says Choong.In contrast, the uncertainties arising from the 14th general election last May did not impact the local bond market significantly as there was still solid demand from domestic investors. The reaffirmation of Malaysia’s sovereign credit rating by major credit rating agencies also lifted sentiment.“Overall, the corporate bond market performed well in 2018 as buying interest for selected AAA and AA-rated bonds continued to outstrip supply amid ample liquidity in the market. Similarly, given the fund’s focus on liquid, high-grade corporate bonds, its performance over the longer term remained relatively stable,” says Choong.In the past few years, two events influenced significant changes in the asset allocation of the fund. One was in 2016 when Bank Negara unexpectedly cut interest rates, citing risks from the UK’s exit from the EU. The team increased its holdings in selected corporate bonds to capitalise on strong buying interest in the local bond market at the time.“Towards end-2017, we rebalanced the portfolio in anticipation that the central bank may normalise interest rates in 2018,” says Choong.According to the fund’s fact sheet dated Jan 31, 2019, its biggest asset allocations were in power, industrial/manufacturing and transport. The allocations were guided by the challenging domestic landscape.“We are overweight on sectors that are resilient to economic cycles such as the power sector due to its long-term, stable and predictable cash flow, steady demand for electricity and the strong credit profile of the electricity ‘offtaker’ — Tenaga Nasional Bhd. We also place strong emphasis on the credit quality of issuers, with a greater focus on consistent and visible cash flows, stringent bond structure and good corporate governance,” says Choong.She expects the global growth momentum to moderate going forward, with the unresolved trade tensions and political uncertainties continuing to cloud the overall growth outlook. Malaysia’s growth prospects will similarly be affected by the heightened uncertainties.“Given the uncertainties ahead, we will stay vigilant and continuously monitor market developments on both the local and global fronts while remaining flexible in managing portfolio durations to respond to changes in the market environment. We will continue to manage the fund actively and maintain a focus on liquid, high-grade bonds with strong credit and stable long-term cash flow,” says Choong. — By Tan Zhai Yun",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lipper-fund-awards-refinitiv-libra-invest-bhd-won-two-fund-awards,"2019-05-01 20:07:43"
465,"April 09, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Will lower LNG prices bring down local energy costs? ","FOR most of the first quarter, the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been languishing at less than US$3 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), lower than the past six-month average of US$3.30.The low price was driven by the huge supply coming from Australia and the US, as well as lower-than-expected demand as winter in the northern hemisphere was less severe than initially anticipated.Industry observers say the situation is likely to persist, as US exports of natural gas are expected to reach nine billion standard cu ft (scf) per day this year, almost twice last year’s volume, according to projections by the US Energy Information Agency (EIA).“With the last of the eight major Australian projects built over the past decade coming onstream, and more volume becoming available from the US, the oversupply situation is likely to be amplified for the rest of 2019, at least in Asia,” says an observer.With supply from Australia and the US expected to remain high, LNG prices are expected to remain at the current low level for the rest of the year. The EIA forecasts that the natural gas price will average US$2.85 per mmBtu this year, some 30 US cents lower than last year.“The spot price for LNG delivered to Northeast Asian customers dropped to US$4.65 per mmBtu in the week to March 21, the lowest since May 2016. That is less than RM20 per mmBtu. Currently, the LNG tariff to non-power users is RM32.92 per mmBtu while power generators pay RM27.20 in Malaysia,” the observer says.This is a rare occasion that the regulated domestic piped gas price in Malaysia is higher than the international price.  This raises the question whether the government will cut the regulated gas price.Industry analysts and observers The Edge spoke to believe so, assuming that the government will adjust the domestic regulated price  responsively according to the international price.Should the regulated gas price be revised downward, this would be good news for local manufacturers, including glove makers, who have been complaining of high gas and electricity prices following a hike in the gas price by Gas Malaysia Bhd and the imbalance cost pass-through (ICPT) surcharge by the Energy Commission.Last December, Gas Malaysia increased the average natural gas base tariff to non-power users in Peninsular Malaysia to RM32.69 per mmBtu, from RM31.92. Together with the 23 sen per mmBtu gas cost pass-through surcharge, this works out to RM32.92 per mmBtu.The new gas tariff applies to January to June this year.“Incentive-based regulation parameters set the market’s natural price at RM35 per mmBtu. If the (international) market price of LNG is lower than this, then the cost savings will be passed on to consumers,” says Hafriz Hezry, an analyst with MIDF Research who covers Tenaga Nasional Bhd.Furthermore, the drop in coal and LNG prices also prompted many to wonder whether that would bring down eletricity tariff.The ICPT was implemented  to enable the fluctuation of fuel costs to be passed down to end-users through adjustments of electricty tariffs every six months.Coal accounts for half the fuel mix for power production, piped gas being the second biggest.Hafriz noted that lower coal prices will reduce the system’s overall generation cost, and any cost savings will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower electricity rates.However, Hafriz notes that the price of the piped gas supply to the power sector is regulated. And that price has been raised by RM1.50 per mmBtu every six months in  order to be on a par with the international price. The piped gas supply volume is also capped at one billion scf per day.“Any excess consumption of natural gas will then be sourced at the market price.  Given that the generation mix is currently skewed heavily towards coal, the power sector hardly hits the one billion scf per day ceiling,” he says via email.The current regulated gas price to the power sector is RM27.20 per mmBtu. This will rise to RM28.70 in the second half, says Hafriz.Meanwhile, his colleague Noor Athila Mohd Razali, who covers the oil and gas industry, believes natural gas prices will recover over the next few months as the equilibrium between demand and supply improves. She says LNG prices tend to be restored within a short period of time if the gyrations were due to the imbalance of supply and demand.Commenting on the EIA’s projection of US exports of natural gas reaching nine billion scf per day this year, Athila says the increase in supply is expected to be absorbed by Europe and Asia — to be led by China.“China saw a 78% improvement in winter air since it began to rigorously switch from coal to the cleaner natural gas due to its desire to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement. There is a growing and increasing need for China to fuel its economy using cleaner energy and this is expected to drive the demand for LNG.“China is now the second largest LNG importer after Japan with imports doubling over the past two years. China’s demand is mainly driven by its industrial sector and residential and commercial use, and we opine that this will continue to be the case going forward,” she says. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/will-lower-lng-prices-bring-down-local-energy-costs,"2019-05-01 20:07:43"

(April 5, RM12.62)
Maintain buy with a target price (TP) of RM15.50: Concerns over the impact of industry reforms appear overly pessimistic and possibly misplaced in our view. We believe these concerns would be alleviated as clarity emerges in the coming months. With that, we expect a rerating of the share price to levels that better reflect Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (TNB) earnings stability.A commonly mooted reform is the possible introduction of retail competition, which would allow third parties into the “customer services” segment. The net operating profit after tax attributable to this segment is merely about RM20 million annually. This does not entail the farming-out of TNB’s existing distribution assets to third parties (such a move would require shareholders’ approval in any case). On a stand-alone basis, the introduction of retail competition is unlikely to move the needle much with regard to tariff savings in our view.Another frequently mentioned reform is the possible migration towards a full “merchant market” in the generation space (where generators bid to produce electricity), thus theoretically driving down tariffs and lowering generation returns. Technicalities aside, current-generation returns (inbuilt into capacity payments) are effectively guaranteed upon fulfilment of availability (not generation) targets under the existing power purchase agreement (PPA) framework. A premature dismantling of the PPA framework would require hefty compensation by the government.Our earnings forecasts and TP of RM15.50 are unchanged. Our TP is derived from a discounted cash flow, assuming 7.5% weighted average cost of capital and 1% long-term growth, implying a financial year 2019 price-earnings ratio of 15.9 times. — Maybank IB Research, April 5",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/rerating-earnings-stability-expected-tnb,"2019-05-01 20:07:44"

468,"April 04, 2019 16:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Another quiet quarter for high-rise residences","Cautious market sentiments are expected to prevail in the near term as the residential high-rise secondary market remained inactive in the last quarter of 2018. The inactivity was due to a lack of improvement in the market following the general election in May last year and the measures announced in Budget 2019, which consisted of a mixed bag of property-related news, says Amy Wong, Savills Malaysia director of research and consultancy, when presenting The Edge/Savills Klang Valley high-rise residential property monitor for 4Q2018.“According to the samples of our research analysis, the transaction volume of high-rise residences in the secondary market dropped in both KL and Selangor in 2018 compared with 2017. KL recorded only half of the total transaction volume compared to the previous year,” she explains.The KL secondary market for high-rises remained quiet in the review period. KLCC and Bangsar recorded no transactions for 2-bedroom units whereas a very limited number of similar properties were transacted in Mont’Kiara.The transaction value was flat in KLCC, Bangsar and Mont’Kiara in 4Q2018. In general, the prices ranged from RM830 to RM1,810 psf in KLCC, from RM750 to RM1,200 psf in Bangsar and from RM610 to RM700 psf in Mont’Kiara.“Further checks revealed that the average asking price in these three zones dropped about 3% quarter on quarter in 4Q2018, although it was still 10% to 15% higher than the average transacted value.“Having said that, the high-rise residential property market in KL is expected to remain challenging due to the large impending supply in the near term,” says Wong.Selangor’s secondary market for high-rise residences was also quiet in the review period with fewer transactions. Both the transaction value and asking price were lower compared with 2017.“We expect high-rise property prices in the Selangor secondary market to be subdued in some locations due to stiff competition from the primary market where developers are offering buyers attractive homeownership packages,” says Wong. Another slow quarter in KLKLCC recorded a lower volume of secondary high-rise residential transactions year on year. Transactions had surged more than 20% in 2017 before halving last year, says Savills Malaysia.Fewer secondary transactions were recorded in KLCC after GE14. According to Wong, this sluggish trend applied to residential units of all sizes, including the sampled 2-bedroom, 1,000 to 1,600 sq ft apartments. “Although the more recent launches, including small offices/home offices (SoHos), focused on smaller units of between 500 and 1,000 sq ft, the secondary market in KLCC is still inclined towards the bigger units of more than 1,500 sq ft. These accounted for over half the secondary market transactions last year.”Some new launches in the primary market in 2016 and 2017 reportedly saw decent take-ups. Stonor 3, 10 Stonor, Eaton Residences and SO Sofitel Kuala Lumpur Residences, for instance, were 50% sold as at 4Q2018. Most of these launches offered 1 to 2-bedroom units of 1,000 sq ft and below, and priced at more than RM1,200 psf.Only RuMa Hotel & Residences was completed in KLCC in 4Q2018, adding 200 units to the market. There were no new launches during this period.“The prospects for high-rise residential properties in KLCC remain challenging. With over 6,000 units of new supply scheduled for completion in KLCC by 2020, there is unlikely to be an upswing in market activity and pricing in the near term,” says Wong.In Bangsar, the overall secondary market saw slower activity year on year with fewer transactions in the second half of last year, particularly in 4Q2018. “Units of between 1,000 and 1,499 sq ft remained popular in the area, accounting for 30% of secondary market transactions last year. As for capital value, high-rise residential properties remained stable year on year,” says Wong.Cascadium recorded its highest transacted price per square foot of RM1,250 in 3Q2018. Asking prices for units of similar size in the development were lower at between RM792 and RM1,185 psf.“According to our conversation with property agents, poorly maintained properties in Bangsar are likely to experience lower asking prices/possible value depreciation,” says Wong.As at 4Q2018, four low-density residential projects were under construction in Bangsar, offering between 18 and 56 units per scheme, and are slated for completion by 2019 to 2020. This year, work is expected to commence on two projects in Bangsar, one of which is the unnamed mixed-use development on the site of the Tenaga Nasional Bhd headquarters and the other a low-density residential development by Xian Property.Unlike in KLCC and Bangsar, Mont’Kiara’s secondary market saw more activity last year despite experiencing lower transaction volume. Savills Malaysia’s analysis reveals that the more than 60% secondary transactions last year consisted of high-rises of 1,500 sq ft and above in size.Fewer 2-bedroom high-rise residential properties were transacted in Mont’Kiara in 4Q2018 while the average price of the samples retracted about 3% quarter on quarter to RM736 psf.Most of the under-construction projects in Mont’Kiara are reportedly 60% to 70% sold. Residensi Astrea Mont’Kiara, for example, had recorded a take-up of 60% as at 4Q2018 since its launch last October.Last year, the launch price of high-rise residential properties hovered between RM620,000 and RM1.2 million or RM630 and RM1,100 psf. Among the incentives offered by developers to attract purchasers were cash rebates, low down payment, and guaranteed rental return.“We don’t expect an upswing in the prices of properties in Mont’Kiara for the near term as the overall market sentiments, especially on the secondary market, are still weak. Also, there will be a bulk of new supply coming into the market between 2019 and 2020,” says Wong. Lower transactions in SelangorThe secondary market in Bandar Sunway was inactive in 4Q2018, prolonging from 1H2018. In the review period, the asking price of 3-bedroom high-rise residences registered a drop of 2% quarter on quarter, hovering at around RM500 to RM800 psf.Recently launched high-rise developments comprised mainly smaller units (including SoHos) with some being dual-key units targeted at the young demographic. For example, Union Suites and Greenfield Residence, launched in 2017, offered units with built-ups of 463 to 1,445 sq ft and 581 to 1,302 sq ft respectively.The latest launch was of Yolo Signature Suites, which offered a total of 395 units with built-ups of 440 to 2,046 sq ft and a gross price of RM900 to RM1,000 psf. As at 4Q2018, the development was reportedly 50% sold.Over in Petaling Jaya, a new supply of 2,769 units entered the market in 4Q2018. In PJ Central, the completions included Biji Living (425 units), PJ Midtown (758 units) and Sapphire Paradigm Residences (229 units). PJ North saw one completion in H2O Residences, comprising 877 condos and 480 SoHos.In 4Q2018, Sime Darby unveiled the final block of Cantara Residences, which offered 188 units with built-ups of 646 to 1,184 sq ft, and recorded a take-up of 80%. Another launch was of the build-then-sell development, Sapphire Paradigm Residences, by WCT Holdings Bhd.In Subang Jaya, the secondary market for high-rise residential properties slowed down last year with transactions reduced by more than 50% year on year. Prices remained unchanged in 4Q2018.There were no new launches in Subang Jaya in 4Q2018. New completions expected in the area in the next two to three years are Paisley Serviced Residences @ Tropicana Metropark (587 condos), Lot 15 Serviced Residences (361 units) and The Grand SS15 (483 SoHos).",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/another-quiet-quarter-highrise-residences,"2019-05-01 20:07:45"

475,"April 01, 2019 16:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Cover Story: Building a sense of neighbourliness","A chance meeting could change one’s life. For Temokin Holdings Sdn Bhd group executive director Datuk Robert Tan Kim Kuan, the serendipitous event occurred when he first arrived at Universiti Malaya in the early 1970s.“In those days, there was no professional career guidance. I only knew the professions of teaching, medicine and law enforcement,” Robert recalls with a smile. “Being a doctor or policeman was out, so I signed up at the science faculty in Universiti Malaya [to be a teacher]. After that, a friend of mine looked at my results and said why don’t I try engineering?“I asked him what an engineer did and he explained it to me. He said engineers construct houses for people to stay in and build roads to get people from one point to another; which I considered noble work. So, instead of going to the science faculty, I went to the engineering faculty. I changed my major and it was God’s guidance.”Robert graduated in 1974 with a degree in civil engineering and started his career in the government sector. After 2½ years, he moved to a consultancy and stayed a further 2½ years before joining YTL Construction, where he rose through the ranks to become chief engineer.In 1990, with a young family, he decided to strike out on his own and founded Temokin Holdings Sdn Bhd. “After 14 years of working for people, I felt I was ready to start my own company. First, I wanted to challenge myself to see how much I could do and, second, I needed more money to feed my family,” he says with a chuckle. “I set up Temokin Holdings with a capital of RM35,000. We then got three Tenaga Nasional substation projects. We did earthworks for Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor (PKNS), a highway in Klang for Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia and a sewage project for PKNS.”The company continued to do well in the 1990s and survived the Asian financial crisis. “In 1997, when the crisis came, I bought a RM2 million microtunnelling machine from Japan. I got two projects, which was more than enough to cover my cost,” says Robert. The mix of private and government projects involved companies such as Dialog Group Bhd, Puncak Niaga Holdings Bhd and Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur. Microtunnelling, also called pipe jacking, uses smaller drills to build underground pipelines, ducts and culverts.Two of his four children — three boys and a girl — became engineers. One of them is his youngest son, Chien Chyi, who is the director of the company’s property development division, Temokin Development Sdn Bhd. “I took up engineering because I had grown up going to work sites and construction sites. I think that exposure showcased that engineering is a good foundation,” he says. “I didn’t think I could do pure engineering, so I moved into property development, which is a natural progression from engineering.”Robert agrees with his son and believes that the communal element of construction marries well with property development. “Construction is very communal. We construct roads for people to go from one point to another, we construct bridges for people to cross rivers, flyovers to ease traffic congestion and channels to supply water to households. We help deal with sewage before it goes into the rivers,” he explains.The move into property development was always a goal for Robert but he held back until 2011, when he incorporated Temokin Development. “When I was in the construction industry, I already had plans to go into property development. I started by buying pieces of land first.”He bided his time until his children had graduated and he encouraged them to work in the family company. “For a company to continue, you must inject new and young blood to make it vibrant. I decided to start the property development division but we took two to three years to learn about the industry before launching our first project.”Products that create a communityTemokin Development wants to come up with products that help create a community feeling through greater engagement. Placemaking — the approach of planning, designing and managing public spaces for the wellbeing of stakeholders — is an integral part of this vision.“We always operate from our group values of ‘WE DIG’, where W is wisdom, E is equality, D is diligence, I is integrity and G is guidance. So with all this, it sparks a communal aspect in our DNA. We want to be a community-based property developer,” says Chien Chyi.Temokin Development’s maiden project — the freehold Mahligai in Nusa Damai, Pasir Gudang, Johor — sits on 11.5 acres and has a gross development value (GDV) of RM100 million. The land was purchased in 2014 for RM10 million or RM35.80 psf.“The surrounding areas are developed and mature. Somehow, the owner of the land, a developer, decided to sell it,” explains Robert.“We named our maiden project Mahligai because the word is Sanskrit for ‘mansion’ and we believe that anyone who buys our product will be able to come home to and enjoy their own mansion,” says Chien Chyi.Robert adds, “Mahligai is also a Malay word. I asked my Malay business partner, who said, to him, it means ‘heaven’. And in heaven, you get peace. So I said ‘Okay, we will go with this name [for our first project].”The development is divided into three phases, says Chien Chyi. “We are launching the development in phases so that we can develop something better [in each phase], to give our buyers a better product. From Phase 1, we collected feedback from buyers, and we have incorporated them into the design of Phase 2.“The target market is Johoreans, a localised market, and first-time homebuyers. The product is uniquely priced and very strategically located. We’re happy to say that 80% of Phase 1, which we launched last year, has been taken up and most of the buyers were within our target market,” he says.Launched last Sept 25, Phase 1 consists of 53 two-storey terraced houses. The 20ft by 70ft homes with built-ups of 1,679 to 1,752 sq ft were priced from RM562,000, or RM368 psf on average. The targeted handover is April 2020.Phase 2, scheduled to be launched next month, features 87 two-storey terraced houses. The 20ft by 70ft homes with built-ups of 1,759 to 1,802 sq ft will have indicative prices starting from RM593,000, or RM393 psf on average.“For security, we have incorporated a guardhouse and are seeking approval from the local council to fence up certain areas to prevent outsiders from entering,” says Chien Chyi.Mahligai will boast of three parks — two larger parks and a pocket park — for residents to enjoy. To create a sense of ownership of these green spaces, Temokin Development has embarked on a placemaking initiative called Kita Bersama. One of its first engagement activities is to gather views from future residents of Mahligai — buyers of Phase 1 as well as prospective buyers — of what they would like to see incorporated in the larger parks, after which a vote will be taken.The pocket park will be landscaped by the developer as it is a small plot. “This is not a strata development but one with individual titles. So we wanted to give the buyers and the local council easy-to-maintain but effective landscaping and practical green space,” says Chien Chyi.After the 11.5 acres are fully developed, the common spaces will be handed over to the local authorities to maintain.No launch date has been set for the last phase but Chien Chyi reveals that the homes will be larger at three storeys and have direct access to the green spaces.The development is accessible via the Pasir Gudang Highway and Senai-Desaru Expressway. Education centres in the vicinity include Sultan Ibrahim Premier Polytechnic Johor Bahru, Universiti Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Industrial Technology, UniWorld International School and The Japanese School of Johor. Mydin, Tesco and Maslee Pasir Gudang Supermarket among others will cater for residents’ grocery and other household needs. KPJ Pasir Gudang Specialist Hospital, Penawar Hospital and Regency Specialist Hospital are also nearby.Developing a presence in the Klang ValleyThe Tans will incorporate their placemaking initiatives in future developments. While it is a good idea, will it be possible to replicate it in other places as it requires plenty of engagement and planning?The Tans are up to the challenge. “Doing something like this [placemaking] isn’t easy. Building highways, tall buildings and so on is not easy. From a construction point of view, nothing is easy,” Chien Chyi says. “So, mirroring that in development, there are so many factors that are not easy. But we want to strive and engage in [placemaking] because we are a people-centric community developer. In whatever development we do, we want to embrace that factor.”Currently, the developer has a land bank of 50 acres, which is spread over the central region of Peninsular Malaysia.“We are launching a project this year in Taman Melati, Gombak — a freehold development on 2.2 acres. We are looking to build 24 landed superlink homes. Built on Malay Reserve land, the houses will be 24ft by 123ft with a built-up of 3,000 sq ft,” says Chien Chyi.“The key aspect is that 12 units will have a dual-key concept. This is because of the maturity of the area and the project’s location near the Gombak LRT station. We’ve found that there is potential capital appreciation for homeowners who want to rent out their second space or keep it for a family member.”The selling price is yet to be set but the estimated GDV is RM40 million. The Tans plan to launch the project in 2H2019.Also in the pipeline is a joint-venture project with Tropicana Corp Bhd on a 2.28-acre freehold parcel located near 3 Damansara in Petaling Jaya. The JV, which will most likely feature a high-rise block, was signed on Sept 27 last year.For now, Temokin Development’s focus will be on the central and southern regions of Peninsular Malaysia and it will bide its time to develop its remaining land bank to ensure that it meets the needs of the market.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-building-sense-neighbourliness,"2019-05-01 20:07:50"

However, many of these tools are not user-friendly and can be difficult to manoeuvre. Clunky interface, limited information and a lack of proper explanations are just some of the complaints of users.To solve these problems, 8Bit Global Pte Ltd (a joint venture between 8VIC Global and 8I Holdings) has developed WealthPark, a smart investing technology platform that provides information on companies listed on stock exchanges around the world.Gary Yeow, director of 8VIC Malaysia Sdn Bhd, says WealthPark was designed to provide investors with a faster, smarter and easier-to-use investment tool. “We know a lot of investors do not have the time [to assess companies]. But they want simple digestible information at their fingertips. WealthPark does most of the work for them. Investors only need five minutes to read up on a company before making a buy or sell decision.”WealthPark gives users access to comprehensive data on companies across 11 categories. They can view up to 10 years’ worth of information, including the companies’ income, balance sheet and cash flow statements and growth performance. The information is accompanied with visuals such as charts and tables for a better overview (see Image 1).WealthPark provides investors with information on companies listed on 24 stock exchanges around the world, including the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, Australian Securities Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Stock Exchange of Thailand and Bursa Malaysia.The platform’s raw data is acquired from Capital IQ, the research division of Standard and Poor’s. Then, it is turned into a simple dashboard interface by WealthPark. While the data is not provided in real time (up to 12 hours delay), Yeow says this should not be a problem to its target users as the tool is intended for long-term value investors who are not looking to make a quick profit.He adds that the amount of data available can be overwhelming, especially to beginner investors. That is why almost every single label on WealthPark can be clicked on for further explanation. Some even come with video tutorials that investors can refer to.Subscribers have access to the WealthPark Learn Facebook page, which provides user support and additional learning materials. The company also holds classes every fortnight for investors who wish to learn more about how they can leverage the tool to make better investment decisions.WealthPark has a lot of features that allow investors to make quick assessments. One of them is WP Rating, a probabilistic framework developed by WealthPark and Singapore-based research firm Hidden Champions Capital Management (see Image 2).The rating examines 13 areas of investment risk due to potential aggressive accounting undertaken by the companies, which are rated either one, two or three stars to denote the level of investment risk. Investors may want to keep this in mind when making their investment decisions, says Yeow.“The WP Rating is one of the features we provide that the other tools in the market do not. The areas we examine include shareholder dilution, where a company can decrease existing shareholders’ ownership of a company with the issuance of new equity. Another area we examine is window dressing, where a company understates its expenses and overstates its profit to present a better-looking financial report,” he adds.Hong Kong-based China Resources Cement Holdings Ltd, for example, is given three stars. All 13 areas of investment risk are given green labels, which indicate that the level of risk is low.A feature that will help investors quickly understand the key aspects of a company is Star Chart, which summarises 107 data points of a company to give investors a visual snapshot of its strengths and weaknesses. The summarised data covers the company’s profitability, financial health, assets held, growth and dividends paid out (see Image 3).To make the data more interesting, the companies are given animal classifications. According to Yeow, there are six animals. For example, the gorilla represents companies that have continually achieved stable and high revenue and/or earnings growth due to their unique and strong competitive advantage.These companies also have the ability to reinvest and compound their earnings at high rates of return, which are suitable for investors who want to explore or invest in companies for capital gains. “Similar to gorilla, cheetah companies have achieved high revenue and/or earnings growth, but may not necessarily be stable,” says Yeow.The other four animals are cow (companies that may pay out consistent and sustainable dividends), elephant (companies that are asset-heavy), sloth (companies with slower revenue or earnings growth than the industry average). Meanwhile the non-animal classification “UFO” refer to companies that cannot be classified.Most value investors calculate a company’s intrinsic value using fundamental analysis to determine whether it is currently under or overvalued. To save investors time, WealthPark does the calculations and visualises them on a line chart.The platform has a healthy pipeline of things it wants to introduce in the future, says Yeow. One that is currently being tested is the portfolio feature, which will allow investors to manually add into these portfolios companies that they are invested in to track the profit and loss of their previous investments. The feature will also be able to calculate investors’ currency gain or loss.“This is a handy feature for those who tend to forget their investments, especially those they made more than three years ago,” says Yeow.WealthPark is also testing the peers feature, which is currently at the beta stage. This feature lets investors compare a company with other similar ones listed on other stock exchanges. This is especially important when assessing companies with a monopoly in the industry, such as Tenaga Nasional Bhd, says Yeow. The companies can be compared by either their gross profit margins, WP Ratings or returns on equity, among others.According to WealthPark, Tenaga’s top peers are Osaka Gas Co Ltd (listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange), NRG Energy Inc and The AES Corp (both listed on the New York Stock Exchange).The platform will introduce more stock exchanges in the near future. WealthPark’s current users are 8VIC graduates and attendees of events organised by the company. The tool will be officially launched to the public in May.WealthPark is available in seven languages, including Bahasa Malaysia, Japanese and Thai. There are three pricing structures. Investors who choose to subscribe to only one stock exchange will be charged US$120 a year. Subscribing to seven exchanges will cost them US$365 a year while subscribing to all exchanges will set investors back US$1,299 a year.The mobile app is available on Google Play and the App Store.

With a reduction in energy cost, the cost to manufacture and deliver goods also drops, leading to reduced cost to consumers,” it said.FMM is hopeful that the measures to be put in place to facilitate investment in energy efficiency initiatives by industry players, especially the small and medium enterprises, could mitigate the volatility in energy prices.“FMM looks forward to continued engagement with the Government in order to sustain the competitiveness of businesses in view of the external uncertainties and concurrent cost increases that are already imposed on businesses,” it said.Earlier today, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) had called on Gas Malaysia Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) to revise the natural gas tariff, as it is expecting a substantial drop in natural gas price due to the sharp fall in prices of liquefied natural gas and coal in recent months.The association pointed to the Asian LNG pricing, using Japan Korea futures, which has fallen by 60% to US$4.62 per MMBtu from its peak at US$11.81 per MMBtu in September last year.The price of coal has also dropped by almost 25% to US$88.25 per tonne from US$118 per tonne as of July 2018.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fmm-concerned-over-icpt-surcharge-hopes-lower-electricity-tariff,"2019-05-01 20:07:57"
488,"March 26, 2019 16:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"BIMB still expected to beat its peers","IN recent years, BIMB Holdings Bhd has consistently outperformed the banking industry on important fronts like return on equity (ROE) and financing growth. But with the operating environment getting increasingly tough, a key question on investors’ minds is, will it be able to sustain the strong growth levels?CEO Mohd Muazzam Mohamed acknowledges that it will be challenging but he is confident the group will keep growing over the next three years, albeit at a more moderate pace.“We used to do double-digit growth in net financing in the past years but since 2017, we slowed to single-digit growth. Last year, we did 8.5% [versus the industry’s 4.5%]. This year, it will moderate further, probably to around 7%, but it would still be above the industry average, I would say. Growth in profit before zakat and tax (PBZT) may be a bit slower too, but there will still be growth,” he tells The Edge in an interview.A financial holding company, BIMB derives about 80% of its earnings from its wholly-owned Islamic lender Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd and the rest from its 59.6%-owned Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd.Two weeks ago, BIMB turned in a record net profit of RM682 million for FY2018, a 10.1% increase year on year, helped by solid financing growth, cost containment and stable margins.Its earnings fell within analysts’ expectations and translated into an ROE of 14.3%, higher than the industry average of around 10%. PBZT grew 12.5% to RM1.07 billion while revenue grew 12.9% to RM4.2 billion.BIMB’s earnings were commendable considering that the group had made an allowance for impairment of financial assets of RM81.4 million — owing mainly to the kicking in of the new MFRS 9 accounting standard — compared with a write-back of RM15.4 million in the previous year. Three-year planAccording to Muazzam, BIMB’s growth over the next three years will be fuelled mainly by consumer financing. However, an increased focus on fee-based income and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) will give the group a boost, he says.BIMB plans to grow fee-based income by driving its bancatakaful and wealth management businesses further. This will be done by increasing product offerings as well as improving staff productivity, he says.“As for wealth management, we’re doing two things. We’re doubling our sales executives to about 200 this year. We’re not hiring new people but converting over 100 of our existing 520 personal financial executives — the people who sell cards, personal and house financing — into wealth executives. Of course, they’ll need to take the necessary exams, obtain licences and all that first. The other thing we’re doing is increasing our products,” he shares.Its fund management firm BIMB Investment Management Bhd has a partnership with UK-based Arabesque Asset Management that it hopes to tap further. Arabesque is an environmental, social and governance (ESG)-Quant specialist that uses robo technology and data analytics when investing.Muazzam says BIMB is open to the possibility of selling up to 40% equity interest in BIMB Investment to Arabesque as it sees value in what its foreign partner brings to the table. It is understood that Arabesque has an option to take an equity stake in BIMB Investment but has yet to exercise it.BIMB’s fee-based income as a percentage of gross revenue stood at below-9% last year on the consumer side, and the target is to increase it to 10% this year and 12% by end-2021.As for SMEs, Muazzam says BIMB’s financing to this segment stood at RM2.2 billion as at-end 2018. He wants to grow this by about 10% this year. “We have so far been focused on the bigger SMEs and not so much on the smaller entrepreneurs. Going foward, we will continue to focus on our vendor programmes with big companies like Petronas, Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia, where we finance [SMEs] that have contracts with them. But, at the same time, we are developing capabilities [that will help us finance] SMEs in the lower-revenue ranks,” he says.For example, he says BIMB is working with a group of professors to come up with a psychometric model.“In the past, a bank’s credit evaluation model was about assessing the customers’ ability to pay. Even though we say we have a behavioural card, what we look at is past payment behaviours. But now, we want to develop a tool for us to be able to assess the customer’s willingness to pay ... because as we go down the [SME] tier, these customers would have less of or little historical credit track record. That’s why banks find it difficult to give them financing. But, as you know, there’ll be a lot more of such companies in the future, so we must develop new tools to assess them,” he says.This is, however, still at the developmental phase. “Hopefully, by 2021, we will be able to launch it so we can go into [financing] online retailers and all that,” he says. CODE21Home and personal financing will remain BIMB’s main growth drivers. Last year, these accounted for 53.4% and 39.4% respectively of its consumer financing portfolio.Muazzam is not overly concerned about the weaker property market affecting the group’s asset quality. “The good thing is that we focus on properties that are priced at RM750,000 and below. Supply and demand is still there, so we are comfortable about building in that segment. On the corporate side, our exposure to real estate is not that big and we are very selective ... the [vulnerable] areas like hotels and big retail malls, we try not to get involved,” he explains.Its exposure to real estate stands at just 3.68% of total financing, while for construction, it is 5.2%.Meanwhile, BIMB’s exposure to the oil and gas sector — an area that analysts continue to monitor closely given weak oil prices — has come down to 8.4% as at end-2018 from 9% a year earlier.“To be honest, for us, there is no specific sector that has been showing a worrying trend,” Muazzam remarks. He points out that BIMB’s asset quality remains strong, with gross impaired financing ratio at just 0.92% as at end-2018, better than the industry’s 1.45%.Muazzam shares that Bank Islam has embarked on a three-year transformation programme, CODE21, so named because it aspires towards culture, operational and digital excellence by end-2021. It involves the improvement of its processes and controls and retraining of staff.The programme is ultimately aimed at making BIMB the country’s leading digital Islamic bank of choice by 2021. BIMB aspires to achieve PBZT of RM1 billion by end-2021, from RM810.3 million last year, says Muazzam.Additionally, it wants to be the leading bank for social finance. Initiatives on this end will be through Sadaqa House, Bank Islam’s donation platform that enables funds to be channelled to needy communities through the bank’s partners.Over the 2019-2021 period, Bank Islam is expected to spend RM300 million on digital initiatives and technology, starting with RM150 million this year.Nevertheless, Muazzam expects BIMB’s cost-to-income ratio (CIR) to lower further to 51% this year from 57.5% last year and 61.4% in 2017.The group’s CIR had been on the high side over the years as it added branches in a bid to reach an optimal level. It currently has 148 branches and has no plans to add more.Muazzam is fairly confident the bank will be able to maintain its net income margin (NIM) at around 2.65% this year as there is less pressure to chase costly deposits. Last year, it scrambled to increase long-term deposits in a bid to raise its net stable funding ratio to over 100%. It raised its base rate by 13 basis points last November.As for Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga, the public-listed company has had good growth in recent years, with PBZT growing at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14.4% over the last five years compared with 3.7% for Bank Islam. “Its PBZT will continue to grow this year, albeit probably not as strongly as last year’s 32.7%,” says Muazzam. Restructuring soonBIMB’s three-year plan does not involve a merger with another bank, says Muazzam. “We don’t rule it out, but at this point in time, there isn’t any proposal on the table. I would say, if we’ve got to merge, it must be with a [partner] that will further strengthen us and not cause the bank to carry extra weight going forward,” he remarks.In the meantime, though, all eyes are on BIMB’s anticipated restructuring exercise, which will involve Bank Islam taking over its listed status. The move is aimed at collapsing BIMB’s financial holding structure.According to Muazzam, there is likely to be an announcement on this in the second quarter. He declines to divulge more details, saying only that the group first has to address a shareholder debt. The Edge reported in late January that BIMB, controlled by Lembaga Tabung Haji, was seriously considering undertaking a private placement of new shares to raise funds to repay a shareholder debt of some RM800 million ahead of the restructuring.“More visibility on BIMB’s much-talked-about restructuring plans could fuel investor interest in the stock, though we think consistent delivery of robust earnings growth would also keep the stock on a positive trajectory,” says AllianceDBS Research in a March 4 report.Bloomberg data shows that eight out of nine analysts who track the stock have a “buy” call on it, with one calling a “hold”. The median target price was RM5.02.According to RHB Research, the stock still has attractive upside, notwithstanding its 19.1% year-to-date increase. “Underlying operations continue to outpace its peers while its balance sheet is healthy. As investors get greater clarity on its reorganisation plans, its price-to-book multiple will rise to levels more reflective of its resilient profitability and position as a proxy to the largest standalone Islamic bank in Malaysia,” it says.   ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bimb-still-expected-beat-its-peers,"2019-05-01 20:07:57"

490,"March 26, 2019 11:30 am +08",TENAGA,"My Say: Policy certainty and investor confidence","There was a stir in the news flow when Khazanah Nasional Bhd’s financial results were released earlier this month. The fund posted its first loss in 15 years — a RM6.27 billion loss before tax in 2018 compared to a RM2.9 billion profit before tax in 2017. The losses were from impairments of some of its investments — a whopping RM7.3 billion. The more appropriate measure of its performance, however, and the more telling one, is the 21.6% drop in the net worth adjusted (NWA) of the portfolio from RM116 billion in 2017 to RM91 billion in 2018.A more detailed look shows that the value of Khazanah’s holdings in its two telcos alone, Axiata Group Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), lost RM8.5 billion in market capitalisation, while the drop in the share prices of Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (CIMB) and IHH Healthcare Bhd (IHH) contributed to the contraction of the NWA. Clearly, market sentiment towards these major Khazanah investee companies turned negative, resulting in the drop of their share prices. The share price of TM opened 2018 at above RM6 and closed the year at RM2.65, hitting a low of RM2.15 along the way. The FBM KLCI, by contrast, contracted only 3% in 2018.The explanation for the contraction of the NWA is a rather straightforward one. While overall market sentiments softened in 2018, the FBM KLCI still outperformed both the MSCI Global and Emerging Market indices. The 21.6% drop in Khazanah’s NWA is, therefore, peculiar to its holdings in selected companies — TM, Axiata, TNB, CIMB, IHH and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB). There were policy and regulatory changes in 2018 that affected these particular companies and, therefore, market sentiments towards them. Herein lies a larger issue.These same companies, all of them public companies, have other investors, institutional and retail, domestic and foreign. These investors too suffered the same losses as Khazanah. Major domestic institutional investors such as the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP) must have invested in these historically well-performing companies and they, too, will have suffered similar losses in value, which will affect both their portfolio values as well as the dividends they pay out to their respective subscribers.Beyond these domestic institutional investors, there are also foreign funds that invest in good performing Malaysian companies. They, too, will have invested in these same companies and they would have suffered the same losses. While some domestic institutional investors are constrained from investing in domestic markets, foreign investors are free to move to where the risk-weighted returns are the best. Some of them have exited our market, with net foreign fund outflow for 2018 totalling RM11.6 billion.What has happened is that policy and regulatory changes adversely affected market sentiments — not just for the specific companies but, more alarmingly, for the Malaysian market more generally. These sporadic bouts of policy changes would have been tolerated by investors if they were part of a broader policy shift that is well communicated and understood, but that is not the case.In the case of the telcos, policy and regulatory changes — on what should have been commercial decisions such as product design and pricing — seriously affected earnings forecasts and, therefore, investors’ valuations of the companies. The drop in share prices simply reflect that outlook. This is the kind of regulatory risks that investors are fearful of. They are capable of assessing companies’ operational efficiency as well as locating them properly within the industry landscape but it is regulatory risks that present a challenge and thus constitutes the larger bulk of risk.Changes in regulatory regimes that are seen as reacting to specific impetus without a broader coherence will just increase the risk profile of Malaysia as a whole. The Malaysian economy can ill-afford the increased risk profile. Our current account surplus has dwindled over the years, closing 2018 at barely 3% of gross domestic product, and it is not expected to improve given sluggish trade sentiments, while the need to borrow and refinance debts will continue. Portfolio outflows make things worse. Therefore, maintaining investors’ confidence and managing the country’s risk profile is of utmost importance.What is still missing at the policy level today is a big picture economic story — phrased positively in terms of what it is rather than what it is not. That will set a direction, a focal point for all other subsidiary stories. It will also identify the lynchpins of the story — the key economic imperatives that drive the whole story, among which, I reckon, is to protect investors’ confidence.Matters of policy relate to the boundary between the state and markets. What is the role of the government in the economy? From the perspective of the capital market, terms like government-linked companies (GLCs) should be properly used or its usage abandoned altogether. Policy and regulations cannot discriminate between GLCs and non-GLCs if a company, a public company, is deemed a GLC merely because statutory funds whose monies do not belong to the government, such as the EPF, PNB and Social Security Organisation (Socso) have shares in it. Are Sime Darby, Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB, Axiata and IJM Corp Bhd government-related companies?In the case of sectors where there used to be natural monopolies, such as utilities and airports, privatised public enterprises such as TNB, TM and Malaysia Airports may still have government holdings in the form of Khazanah shares in them, but these are publicly listed companies with sizeable private and even international investors, and they should neither be favoured nor made victims of policy or regulations.These are commercial entities and should be treated as such — treated by how they behave in the marketplace rather than according to their lineage or even the composition of their shareholders. Commercial disputes between companies, for example, should be matters resolved by the rule of law without the parentage of companies being taken into consideration, what more direct government intervention.The whole point of the Putrajaya Committee for GLC High Performance programme launched in 2004 was to improve the performance of the 20 publicly listed companies that had either significant holdings by statutory funds or a governmental legacy so that they are subjected to market discipline and their governance be made equally transparent.When the 10-year programme ended in 2015, the total shareholder return of these 20 companies grew at 11.1% annually and their aggregate market capitalisation increased from RM133.8 billion to RM386 billion — almost a three times multiple.Beyond that, the regulatory environment was improved mainly by clearly demarcating policy, which can get enmeshed with the political imperative of the government and regulation, which should be driven by promoting healthy competition to attract investors into industries. Empowering shareholders and the presence of regulators, independent of policymakers, create a rules-based environment, the kind of environment investors prefer.The problematic part of government’s presence in the economy are the numerous companies established by the various statutory bodies. There has been a proliferation of these companies. These are not government-linked companies, but outright government-owned, effectively state-owned enterprises (SOEs). They should be properly labelled and need some sort of rationalisation, and a major part of public sector reform should be a serious re-examination of the government’s use of non-governmental organisations — companies established under the Companies Act — as policy tools.The government has been using companies as policy tools in the form of SOEs to achieve bumiputera participation objectives but this approach has not worked. Compare this to the much better performance of funds such as PNB using the capital markets to invest and therefore support performing firms, but the firms they invest in should be treated neutrally by the regulations.These are not GLCs, certainly not SOEs, but public companies with a wide spectrum of investors whose collective performance defines the health of the country’s economy. Truth be told, PNB operating in the capital market has been more successful in achieving the bumiputera agenda objectives than most other policy tools.Clarity in these fundamental issues will create the right environment and the right incentives for investors to decide which enterprises to support and what, in their view, are potentially profitable ones. The government should have a facilitative and not a participative role. It should focus on providing policy clarity and regulatory certainty to attract investments. In order to obtain such an outcome, the government must first articulate a big picture story that sets a strategic direction understood by all interested parties.Nungsari A Radhi is an economist.

With a yield of 20%, only China’s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index provided better returns.Although the FBM KLCI recorded a slight 0.7% decline, Bursa Malaysia as a whole saw an 11.8% gain year to date, adding RM50.4 billion to its market capitalisation.This marks a strong recovery from the selldown in the second half of last year, which was led by foreign selling in the aftermath of a historic and unprecedented change in government after the 14th general election.A total of RM119.3 billion was wiped out of Bursa after GE14 in May until the end of last year.UOB Asset Management (M) Bhd chief investment officer Francis Eng sees the robust start in the small-cap space this year as a recovery from the selldown last year.He says there is value in selected small-cap companies following the decline last year and lists the preferred sectors as technology and manufacturing, particularly semiconductor equipment makers and consumer-related companies. “We also see pockets of opportunity in the beaten-down and unloved sectors, such as oil and gas and construction,” Eng tells The Edge.He attributes the performance of the small caps to the low base effect. “Amid the headwinds faced by emerging markets, including Asia, last year, the FBM KLCI was one of the better performing indices with a decline of 5.9%.“In comparison, the decline in the FBM Small Cap Index was much sharper at 33.7%. Even with the gain year to date, the FBM Small Cap Index is still down 23.9% compared with the start of last year. We attribute the improved performance of the FBM Small Cap Index this year to its relative underperformance last year and improved risk appetite as the headwinds faced by Asia have reduced.”Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong also believes last year’s selldown has created openings for investors looking beyond the benchmark index. Among his pick of sectors to invest in is oil and gas, which has seen a turnaround this year, in line with the recovery in Brent crude prices. “We actually returned to the oil and gas space towards the end of last year as we felt most of the downside had been priced in. Of course, the price of oil plays a role in lifting the mood of investors but what’s important is that we’re also seeing more activities this year,” Wong observes.Coming off last year’s “yo-yo trend” — thanks to the uncertainties raised by production cuts led by Opec+ as well as the tweets of US President Donald Trump on oil prices — Brent crude hit a multi-year high of US$84.93 per barrel in October before slipping to a one-year low of US$50.47 at the end of last year. Prices had inched up to US$67.80 per barrel at the time of writing.Given its average return of 45.5% year to date, oil and gas is the top performing sector so far this year, its upward trend lifting stocks in the category.Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd returned to the black in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, with a net profit of RM97.72 million, and has since been rewarded with a 213% surge in its share price.Also impressive is Petra Energy Bhd’s 189% gain after bouncing back into positive territory in its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, with a net profit of RM20.88 million.Other players trending upwards include Uzma Bhd, Velesto Energy Bhd, T7 Global Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd and Sapura Energy Bhd.Notable improvements have also been seen in construction, whose average return is 24.8% year to date. David Loh, senior portfolio manager at Affin Hwang Asset Management, says a possible revival of the East Coast Rail Link has lifted sentiments on the sector, which was hit by a slew of project cancellations last year.“Judging from public statements made by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the project’s cost should drop substantially to below RM30 billion. This can be achieved by tweaking ECRL’s design and lowering its specifications. If you assume 30% local content, the jobs available to Malaysian contractors is only RM9 billion,” he says, adding that as competition for the tender packages is expected to be intense, margins are unlikely to be great.His firm has taken positions in selective construction stocks that are trading far below their asset value. “We believe there is potential in these companies to monetise assets and unlock value for shareholders. Should that happen, management can use the sale proceeds to pay special dividends and pare down borrowings.”There are also signs of interest in companies that were previously shunned by investors for their perceived links with the previous Barisan Nasional (BN) government.KUB Malaysia Bhd, MyEG Services Bhd, Media Prima Bhd and George Kent (M) Bhd are some of the counters that have seen a surge in buying volume.Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau believes small caps will continue to enjoy an uptick but he also points to external risks, including the ongoing US-China trade talks as well as Brexit negotiations. FBM KLCI not reflective of marketTo Areca Capital’s Wong, the FBM KLCI is not reflecting Bursa and has been dragged down by a few notable decliners this year, namely Petronas Dagangan Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Top Glove Corp Bhd.“The benchmark index only consists of 30 companies and it was dragged down by a few heavyweights while the banking sector, which dominates the index, has been relatively flat so far,” he says.For instance, TNB, which has about 9.95% weightage on the FBM KLCI, is down 6.6% year to date while CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (7.38% weightage) has shed 4.6%.An analyst with a local investment bank agrees, saying newcomers to the benchmark index, such as the glove manufacturers as well as Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd, which have done well in the past few years, have been affected by profit-taking activities as their valuations are near historical highs.The top decliners so far among the indice’s component stocks are Hartalega (25%), Top Glove (22%) and Sime Darby Bhd (10%).Genting Bhd and Genting Malaysia Bhd, on the other hand, are the top gainers with a total return of 16.1% and 14.6% respectively, followed by IHH Healthcare Bhd at 9.6%.Despite their strong gains, the total weightage of the three counters only makes up 8% of the benchmark index — less than TNB on its own.With the year just a fortnight shy of its quarter mark, investors are likely to have more to cheer about than to moan, given that 356 counters have posted double-digit gains, 265 counters are on a positive trend and only 224 counters are in the red.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-opportunities-oil-gas-construction,"2019-05-01 20:07:59"

(March 19, RM1.85)
Maintain hold with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.66: Sunway Construction Group Bhd (SunCon) is the largest listed construction pure play in Malaysia. Given its strong track record, we think SunCon will remain relevant for public and private sector projects despite the current more challenging construction landscape. SunCon has also established itself as the only construction specialist involved in all three Rapid Line infrastructure projects — the mass rapid transit, light rail transit (LRT) and bus rapid transit. 
At the current valuations, we prefer exposure to the larger-cap contractors trading at cheaper or parity valuations and are more diversified. Until we see a more sustained roll-out in government infrastructure projects, we think purer play contractors such as SunCon should trade at a discount to the larger ones. Still, we acknowledged SunCon’s solid execution track record, net cash balance sheet and sustainable dividend payout.SunCon’s new order wins in financial year 2018 (FY18) moderated to RM1.6 billion after hitting RM4 billion in FY17. Its FY19 forecast new win target has been set at RM1.5 billion with an equal distribution between internal and external jobs. Year-to-date wins amount to RM781 million, including the Tenaga Nasional Bhd project. In our view, a flawless execution track record, a faster recovery in its precast division leading to a potential uplift in earnings and a sustained dividend payout could be the next catalysts for the stock. While we have factored in the reduced contract values for its LRT3 project, the build-up in receivables and collection for the project remains in question.Our TP is based on a sum-of-parts valuation to reflect a growing contribution from its high-margin precast business. We believe pure-play construction players should at least trade at parity to its more diversified larger-cap peers in times of rising government development expenditure. The timely execution of its peak order book is crucial to minimising the risk of any earnings cuts. With its strong execution track record and experience, we believe the group is able to execute the projects in a timely manner. — AllianceDBS Research, March 19",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/precast-recovery-expected-lift-sunway-construction-group-profit,"2019-05-01 20:08:06"

The decision is “less to do with Brexit but more to do with our plans in the near future,” he said.The Malaysian fund, owner of stakes in some of the nation’s biggest listed companies, is seeking to cut nonperforming assets in the wake of a slump in the net worth of its portfolio amid an uncertain global economy. The Brexit drama adds more gloom as the prospect of a clean break with the EU on the March 29 exit deadline unnerves Asian companies.Khazanah’s total returns are represented by growth in net value of its portfolio, which declined 21.6% in 2018 to RM91 billion (US$22 billion).

Following Malaysia’s historic election last May, the new government under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sought a reset of Khazanah which involved a refreshed mandate for the fund.Shahril told Bloomberg Television earlier that while Khazanah will focus on growing Malaysia’s assets base for the long term, it has no plans to pull back on its overseas investments as it seeks to optimize risk-adjusted returns over a 10-year period.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/khazanah-mulls-closing-london-office,"2019-05-01 20:08:06"

If it is just listings for the sake of listings, the government will not get good valuation as people will not be interested to invest. The government has to see where the demand is in the market and then look at which companies it can list and sell at a good price,” he said.Astramina Advisory Sdn Bhd managing director Wong Muh Rong concurred that Petronas is a likely candidate, given that it is a world-class company with reputable governance, comparing it to Saudi Arabia’s national oil and gas company Saudi Aramco which is also planning an initial public offering in 2021.“The government does not need to let go of a substantial portion of its shareholdings as they can already raise a lot of funds just by monetising a 20% to 30% stake in Petronas.“Petronas is a good candidate. It is not difficult to sell and the government can get fairly good upfront money and use it to boost market activity,” said Wong.On the other hand, another fund manager, who declined to be named, said it is unlikely that an offer for Petronas would be on the table but noted that the government could start divesting its holdings in some of the relatively smaller companies first.“I don’t think the government will list Petronas as it is considered a strategic asset. They can still monetise [it] but maybe just a minority stake or a division under the group,” said the fund manager.He pointed to Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera’s portfolio which includes Affin Bank Bhd and Boustead Holdings Bhd, and said that the government could test the water with the sale of smaller stakes to see how the market reacts before touching the bigger investments.Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie said the investments that could potentially be disposed of depend on the government’s definition of “matured assets”.“Based on Khazanah’s new mandate, it seems to be referring to businesses that can already stand on their own feet, with decent price-to-book that no longer needs institutional funds as anchor investors.“The companies that come to mind in terms of monetisation could be CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, TM and other companies in the utility and aviation sectors,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/listing-unlisted-glcs-will-improve-operations-%E2%80%94-fund-managers,"2019-05-01 20:08:06"

510,"March 18, 2019 17:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Who’s right about Khazanah’s 2018 (under)performance?","EVIDENTLY, billion-ringgit headline losses were too good an opportunity to gain political mileage to let slip, going by the heated social media exchanges between Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali and former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak last week.When it comes to reported numbers, Najib — who was chairman of Khazanah Nasional Bhd until May 31 last year — is not wrong in saying that the sovereign wealth fund’s RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 were the first it has reported in over a decade.Yet, part of the reason for last year’s underperformance was Khazanah’s portfolio of assets, which was concentrated in a handful of companies it had long invested in. The concentration risk was partly why Khazanah needed to rebalance its portfolio to deliver on its new mandate of growing Malaysia’s long-term wealth.A strategic review of its investments resulted in a RM7.3 billion impairment provision for 2018.“Roughly half” of the RM7.3 billion impairment was due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which Khazanah nationalised in 2014 after paying RM1.4 billion for the remaining 30% stake it did not own.Had that sizeable impairment for the loss-making national carrier been deemed necessary in 2017, Khazanah’s total impairment that year would have been nearer to RM5.95 billion — more than double the RM2.3 billion it booked that year. An impairment of that size would have wiped out the fund’s RM2.896 billion pre-tax profits for 2017 and resulted in two straight years of losses, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. Kitchen-sinking?Khazanah does not expect any large impairments to take place this year, even as Malaysia Airlines goes through another round of strategic review to improve its performance.“Khazanah should be able to return to profit [in 2019], given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books,” managing director Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said on March 5 when presenting the company’s annual review. He also provided more details on its dual-basket — strategic and commercial — investment fund structure, objectives and targets.The sovereign wealth fund will need at least five to seven years to rebalance its portfolio into one that can sustainably provide consistent supplementary income to the government, Shahril told The Edge in a recent interview. Apart from supporting the government’s developmental goals via its strategic investments, its commercial fund will be more diversified in terms of asset allocation, sector and geography.As it is, its portfolio concentration risk can also be seen from its so-called net worth adjusted (NWA) value where one-third of the RM25 billion or 21.6% year-on-year decline to RM91 billion as at end-2018 came from two companies — Axiata Group Bhd (-RM5 billion) and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (-RM3.5 billion).Other sizeable downward NWA adjustments were made for its holdings in Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-RM1.5 billion) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-RM200 million). The six made up RM14 billion or 56% of Khazanah’s NWA decline. Domestic factors, dealsWhile global markets underperformed last year on the back of geopolitical tension and pessimism over growth in emerging markets, Khazanah’s portfolio performance was further hampered by domestic developments, including regulatory changes, subdued earnings outlook and market volatility.To be sure, the headline RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 are sizeable.Still, the RM7.3 billion (non-cash) impairment does not affect Khazanah’s cash flow position and capacity to pay RM1.5 billion in dividend for 2018. The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends and booked RM1.4 billion divestment gains last year, down from RM3.1 billion in dividends and RM2.8 billion divestment gains in 2017.Khazanah paid RM30 million in dividend in 2005 when it reported a RM831 million pre-tax loss. It paid RM100 million in dividend in 2008 when it reported a RM223 million net loss in 2018. For 2019, the guidance is for “RM1 billion to RM1.5 billion” in dividend.It is understood that Khazanah’s sale of a 16% stake in IHH to Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM8.42 billion, which is targeted to be completed by end-March, is still awaiting foreign regulatory approval. According to Shahril, the proceeds will be used to rebalance its portfolio to generate greater returns for the country.A separate 26% stake in IHH is up for sale at the right price, as long as it does not destroy the value of the remaining holdings in Khazanah’s commercial basket. Other assets in the basket include its holdings in CIMB, Axiata and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Co, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.Meanwhile, assets in its strategic basket are Malaysia Airlines, Telekom Malaysia, Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia Airports and PLUS Malaysia Bhd. Developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd (TARH), Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd are also in this basket where economic benefits to the country also count as returns.It remains to be seen if UK-listed Merlin Entertainments plc, which makes money from operating Le­goland Malaysia on behalf of TARH, would buy a stake in the asset from Khazanah — just like how Mitsui had increased its stake in IHH by buying more shares from Kha­zanah. Talk of the potential sale of Legoland or an IPO of Khazanah’s theme parks had been circulating for some years.While Shahril said Khazanah was “not in talks with anyone and there are no offers on the table” when asked about the sale of Le­goland, he did not dismiss the possibility. “Everything has a value at the end of the day and if a great valuation comes in, we will look and see whether the capital that can be returned to our books can be better deployed in other areas,” he said, noting that Legoland is already profitable.Apart from behaving more like a portfolio manager to derive greater returns on its commercial assets, Khazanah is also targeting better cost-efficiency by cutting its cost-to-realisable asset value (RAV) ratio from 50 basis points in 2018 to 30 to 35 basis points in 2023. Part of this could come as it vacates premium office space at the Petronas Twin Towers in favour of transit-oriented Mercu UEM in KL Sentral. Khazanah, which has a long-term lease for 11,500 sq ft at The Shard in London, also has offices in Istanbul, Beijing, Mumbai and San Francisco.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example … we need people on the ground to ensure those assets are managed well and are creating value for Khazanah as a whole. Some of the other offices, for instance in London, may be less important because we will be adopting a more market-driven approach … if there is a cost benefit to us by running the international offices in a different way, we will make those decisions as we go along,” Shahril said.If Khazanah succeeds in becoming a significant revenue contributor to the government, there will be more money to improve the people’s well-being and less pressure to raise taxes. For the electorate, tangible benefits from sound public policy should ring truer than fleeting attention on social media.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/whos-right-about-khazanahs-2018-underperformance,"2019-05-01 20:08:12"

514,"March 18, 2019 07:00 am +08",TENAGA,"Building trust is not just the CEO’s job","For businesses and corporates, trust is a powerful currency that is often attached to their management’s reputation, among other things.Hence the aftermath of the 14th general election (GE14) in May 2018, when Corporate Malaysia saw many abrupt changes at the helm of larger companies that, eventually, turned the spotlight on the affected businesses.Among the questions that arose were how should companies protect the trust they have amid unplanned leadership shifts, and how should they mitigate any impact on confidence such changes has had.The answer is to consider the long-term effect when it comes to trust, according to PwC Malaysia managing partner Sridharan Nair, or Sri as he is known.An organisation that has built up its reservoir of trust and embedded it as part of corporate values can stand the test of time regardless of leadership changes, Sri explains.“There is a saying that consistency is the true foundation of trust. So if you do not have that consistency in an organisation, then this raises doubts [among stakeholders].“So, a balance has to be struck — the person whose face is on the front is the leader, but it is the organisation which [provides support], so it is not just what the leader says but how the group behaves as well,” he adds.That said, the onus of building confidence — or renewing it, as the case may be — lies with a company’s management that is often seen as its face as well.And the leader needs the backing of the organisation to be successful in doing that, says Sri.“The tone at the top needs to be set, essentially, to say ‘we need to promote integrity at the highest levels all the way through the organisation’,” he tells The Edge.“However, it is not just about rolling out a plan or initiative; it is how you see it through, from the actions to the enforcement of it [throughout the organisation],” he adds.The growing spotlight on the role of leadership in trust is accorded consideration in the PwC Malaysia Building Trust Awards, which returns this year for the third time since its inaugural edition back in 2015.The biennial awards recognise companies that are making significant moves in building integrity through their communications and interactions with stakeholders.To recap, no submissions or nominations are accepted for the awards. Instead, only the top 50 Malaysian public-listed companies (PLCs) on Bursa Malaysia by market capitalisation are considered.The annual reports of these 50 companies are then benchmarked against the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework (refer to Methodology). This would be based on the latest available annual reports as of June 2018. Following this, a total of 20 companies are then shortlisted. For this year, the 20 finalists listed in alphabetical order are: AirAsia Group Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, BIMB Holdings Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Digi.com Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, KLCCP Stapled Group, Malayan Banking Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Maxis Bhd, MISC Bhd, Petronas, RHB Bank Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Sunway Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.PwC Malaysia assurance and people partner Pauline Ho says on top of the existing assessment methodology, an additional survey was introduced this year as part of three dimensions of measuring trust perception in collaboration with The Iclif Leadership and Governance Centre (Iclif).According to Ho, the extra survey looks at trust in leadership as the first dimension. The review is designed for an organisation’s employees to answer questions surrounding leadership and their confidence in their company’s leadership team.For the second dimension, PwC conducts an independent survey via a third party to comb through online sources of data for conversations about trust on the 20 shortlisted organisations in order to build a trust profile for each.“The third dimension is a public poll, which is open to the public until March 31, 2019, where we get anyone who is not working within the organisation to comment on whether these [companies] are building trust,” says Ho.“[Through this] we have these different perspectives so that we not only listen to what the companies say about themselves, but also what employees think about their leadership and what the third parties are saying, as well as the public opinion,” Ho concludes.The findings will then be deliberated on by an independent panel of four judges who will select the winners.Rounding up the 2019 Building Trust Awards panel of judges are Sir David Tweedie who is the chairman of the board of trustees of the International Valuation Standards Council and past chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board; Tan Sri Dr Jemilah Mahmood who is under secretary general, partnerships at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; Malek Ali, who is the founder of BFM 89.9; and Nadiah Wan, the group CEO of TMC Life Sciences Bhd and CEO of the Thomson Hospital, Kota Damansara.The results will be revealed at an awards ceremony to be held in Kuala Lumpur, which is scheduled to take place in the second half of the year.This year, PwC also engaged the growing start-up community to understand their perspective on trust. However, start-up organisations are not part of the awards, which are currently meant for PLCs only.From the engagement, it is clear that large corporates can draw important lessons from start-ups on how to protect trust, which is vital to any start-up’s long-term survival, says Sri.“If they (start-ups) cannot get that (trust management) right, they believe that they are not going to be able to survive as a business. And I think that is probably a lesson for larger corporates where as you get bigger, you may have other priorities such as expansion or other engagement with stakeholders and shareholders as opposed to which segment actually makes your business work, which is the consumers who buy your products or services,” says Sri.“So we have seen the larger corporates refocusing on consumers and customers over the years. Their focus is on consumers and making sure that they get their consumers to believe in their idea and to address and to be very responsive to those consumers’ comments as well,” he adds.Interestingly, many start-ups feel that it is easier to boost trust as a big business, Sri reflects. On the other hand, start-ups also believe they can build up their trust reservoir through technology much faster, he adds.“They also believe that in the start-up phase, they can connect with the consumers quicker and in a more authentic manner than much more established businesses.“And, for established businesses, when you go into something that is new, it is more difficult to build trust because you are seen as this sort of business and doing this sort of thing, [but] trying to venture into something new.”In any case, the growing trust awareness in the business ecosystem in Malaysia is positive given that the private sector is a key driver of the economy, Sri says.“At the end of the day, it is about having businesses, corporates and start-ups, having the dialogue and discussion about the importance of trust. Businesses have a big role to play, and if we are able to raise the bar on how important trust is, then we are heading in the right direction.”To participate in the online poll, please visit http://bit.ly/pwctrustpoll 2019. CEOs weigh in on trust...As a leader, how do you inspire a culture of trust in Maybank?
Trust is ultimately about aligning personal and collective interests of a group to a pre-agreed destination — relying on each individual to do his part, so that the outcome is greater than the sum of the parts. The challenge is to ensure agreement among members that group interests should always take precedence over personal ones. It is ultimately a balancing act that needs to be monitored constantly.— Datuk Abdul Farid Alias,
Group President & CEO,
Malayan Banking Bhd (winning company of the 2015 awards) How did Sime Darby Group sustain employee trust amidst the leadership changes following the demerger?
With the new leadership team in place, we set out to meet with groups of employees across our operations. These sessions were essentially open platforms for employees to air any concerns or questions they had, and for them to share their thoughts and ideas for the new organisation. They also provided us the opportunity to communicate our new vision, strategy and targets, and to project the new culture for Sime Darby Bhd.  — Datuk Jeffri Salim Davidson,
Group CEO,
Sime Darby Bhd (winning company of the 2017 awards) How can leaders articulate trust in a simple yet meaningful manner to their employees?  
For leaders to express trust to their employees, there must be commitment to a purpose that entails creating a better future for their people. Not only is it important for employees to know that their leader is committed to a worthy purpose; the leader must pursue that purpose based on the right set of values.  Deeply held values play a huge role in earning trust. Earning the trust of one’s employees is not just a soft, nice-to-have asset; it is the hard currency that makes a difference between success and failure.How can leaders build trust for their organisation’s long-lasting success?
Leaders build trust for their organisations through their actions – by setting direction that creates meaningful value for their stakeholders and enables empowered decision-making. In addition, leaders focus on designing the structures, deploying the right resources and supporting systems to execute the strategy. Underpinning all this, is the accountability for creating a culture of long-lasting excellence based on the right values and leading by example.—  Rajeev Peshawaria,

Those five years of losses have eaten up RM901 million of retained profit.Given that, it is not surprising that Mudajaya is not appealing to investors although the stock has tumbled to 30.5 sen — the lowest level since November 2006. The stock was trading at the RM2.60 level five years ago.Although Mudajaya is not a hot stock on Bursa Malaysia currently, the group is participating in major infrastructure projects, including the Mass Rapid Transit  (MRT) Line 2 and Light Rail Transit (LRT) Line 3. Mudajaya has also secured a number of civil work contracts that were worth over RM1 billion at refinery and petrochemical integrated development project in Pengerang, southern Johor.The group’s order book is currently at slightly more than RM1 billion.“Our local operation is profitable but it is shadowed by the impairment that we booked in for the operation in India,” said its chief executive officer James Wong. “We are currently tendering jobs to replenish our order book.”Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Wong said, the group is expected to return to the black in the second half of the current financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 (FY19), judging by the current project orders in hand and the performance of its recurring income-generating assets.For FY18, Mudajaya’s net loss swelled to a record high of RM402.4 million versus RM120.8 million the year before. Its revenue, however, grew 40% to RM762.6 million from RM545.3 million in FY17.The group incurred impairment of RM145.5 million in FY18, in addition to its share of losses in an associated company amounting to RM213.1 million. Operation-wise, it generated an operating income of RM47.38 million compared with RM76.28 million a year ago.Wong explained that the impairments in FY18 are primarily related to the IPP (independent power producer) project in India due to the impact of the proposed restructuring plan of power assets under the Reserve Bank of India framework.“With the completion of testing and commission of Unit IV by March this year, the construction phase of the IPP project will be considered fully completed.“The outstanding challenges that remain will be to secure a PPA (power purchase agreement) for Unit IV and its associated working capital,” said Wong.He expects further share of losses in the next two financial quarters in the Indian operation. The losses are mainly from depreciation and interest cost of the completed units but have yet to commence power sales.The group’s venture into the Indian power production industry goes as far back as in 2009. It initially brought high hopes that the electricity production project in the continent, where power shortage is acute, would be a cash cow generating steady cash flow and recurring income to Mudajaya.The group took up a 26% stake in RKM Powergen Pvt Ltd — a joint venture with India’s RK Powergen & Associate — to undertake the construction of the power plant in Chhattisgarh state, with an estimated investment of RM5 billion.However, it was never smooth sailing. The project encountered a host of challenges, including securing coal supply and renegotiating a PPA due to change of government policy there.According to Wong, the first three units of the power plant have already secured a PPA through an open tender process.“Notwithstanding this, we remain confident that the IPP project in India will generate positive results once power sales from all four units commence in the near future,” he said.Beside India, Mudajaya owns a 46% stake in PT Harmoni Energy Indonesia which runs a power plant in Sulawesi.On the home front, the group has set its foothold in solar farming. Its solar photovoltaic power plant of 49MW in Sungai Siput, Perak, has achieved commercial operation in late November last year. It has signed a 21-year power purchase agreement with Tenaga Nasional Bhd.Commenting on the group’s balance sheet, Wong acknowledges that the concern on its high gearing at above 200% and its potential impact to the group’s credit standing. But he stresses that the current level of gearing is “manageable”.“With the improvement in the performance of our ongoing businesses, this will continue to strengthen our equity base.“In addition, the management is actively looking at streamlining its balance sheet by monetising its non-core assets to pare down its borrowing and also explore options on [a] corporate exercise to beef up its capital base and meet its funding and investment needs,” Wong explained.After years of disappointments, analysts and fund managers might not pin much hope on Mudajaya’s power project in India. Some reckon there could still be a long passage before the power plant starts contributing to the bottom line.Nonetheless, Mudajaya has not given up. In Wong’s opinion, this could just be the last mile in the cross-country run after having tumbled into a rough patch.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mudajaya-sees-ray-hope-turning-around,"2019-05-01 20:08:22"

At the same time, the government initiated a reset of Khazanah, which involved significant changes including a refreshed mandate,” he said at the Khazanah annual review yesterday.The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends from its investments in 2018, down 9.7% from the RM3.1 billion it recorded in the previous year, while divestment gains halved to RM1.4 billion for the year from RM2.8 billion, reflecting the challenging market conditions during the year.“Looking ahead into 2019, Khazanah should be able to return to profit, given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books. We don’t expect any more large impairments that we have to go through again in 2018.“The provisions are primarily due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which accounted for roughly half of the total impairments for 2018,” he said.Its portfolio’s realisable asset value (RAV) — or the market value of all equities, securities and cash held — fell to RM136 billion in 2018 from RM157 billion a year ago. In terms of net worth adjusted — which is RAV less total liabilities and adjusted to measure value created — that fell 21.6% to RM91 billion from RM116 billion, weighed by subdued earnings outlook, market volatility and regulatory changes. Challenging conditions in the airline industryShahril said the airline industry is challenging, as he pointed to persistent overcapacity and how airlines in the country, such as the region’s leading low-cost airline AirAsia Bhd, are also struggling.While Malaysia Airlines was a drag on Khazanah’s financials for 2018, he justified the fund’s investment in the airline by saying that it provides other economic benefits to the country beyond the fund’s bottom line. As an example, he cited the connectivity it provides that brings business and leisure travellers into Malaysia, which indirectly contributes to the economy.However, he said that does not discount the fact that the national airline should be as operationally efficient as possible.“Quite clearly, the strategy put in place for Malaysia Airlines has not met its objectives. That is a fact we have to acknowledge. The question now is whether it makes sense to continue with the same strategy or do we need to rethink how the airline operates given the challenging environment?“We are waiting for Malaysia Airlines to complete its review and we will be looking at understanding what that startegy requires,” he said. Drop in TM’s market valueAnother factor that drove Khazanah into the red was Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), which saw a substantial fall in market value following the 83% drop in the group’s net profit for 2018, which Shahril attributed to regulatory changes.TM registered a 56.9% decline in total returns, the biggest decliner in Khazanah’s portfolio, followed by Axiata Group Bhd (-26.9%), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-9.3%), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-7.9%), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-7.6%) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-3.3%).Shahril said the market has priced in the fact that TM will take some time to improve its cost base, following the government’s move to bring down consumer pricing as quickly as possible.As the telecommunications company shifts its pricing to reflect the new regulatory environment, revenue will be affected, he said, but added that profitability will return given time. Portfolio rebalancing to spread risk concentrationMeanwhile, Shahril said the fund will remain focused on executing its portfolio rebalancing strategy and strengthening its financial position.He stressed that Khazanah is looking at long-term returns and that it is natural for there to be fluctuations in the market over long periods of time, especially since the fund’s portfolio is very much equity-based. “The key thing to focus on is the fact that we are restructuring the portfolio and are geared towards long-term returns,” Shahril said.The portfolio rebalancing, he said, will look at taking out some of the inherent risks in its portfolio, such as the concentration of risk it is facing given that a big chunk of its investments in Malaysia are tied up in just a few companies. So, over time, Khazanah will have a more balanced portfolio spread over more sectors and geographies to mitigate the concentration of risk, and benefit from a more diversified portfolio.Khazanah is also splitting its portfolio into two — commercial and strategic. The commercial portion targets returns equivalent to inflation plus 3% on a five-year rolling basis. It will comprise public assets such as CIMB, Axiata, IHH and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Company Sdn Bhd, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.The strategic portion is a developmental fund targeting returns equivalent to the 10-year Malaysian Government Securities yield on a five-year rolling basis. It includes strategic assets such as TM, TNB, MAB and PLUS Malaysia Bhd and developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia.Meanwhile, as part of the review of the fund’s operational costs, Khazanah is looking at the operations of its international offices and may take steps to improve their operations.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example.

The remainder 60% in BHP is owned by Sabah-based Warisan Tarang Construction Sdn Bhd, which The Edge Malaysia weekly previously reported was perceived to be connected to Sabah Umno and former Chief Minister Tan Sri Musa Aman.MMC said the termination is on the grounds of national interest, and will take effect five months from April 22.Far East Holdings Bhd is proposing to acquire 2,134 hectares of oil palm plantation land in Rompin, Pahang, and a palm oil mill from Harn Len Corp Bhd for RM182.99 million cash.Far East said it will fund the acquisition through internally-generated funds.The group said the palm oil mill has a capacity of 40 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches per hour.Far East said the proposed acquisition is in line with its expansion plan and will broaden the group’s income base through increased plantation acreage at a ""reasonable"" cost and at a strategic location.Public Bank Bhd posted a marginal 0.34% increase in first-quarter net profit to RM1.41 billion from RM1.405 billion a year ago, mainly due to lower loan impairment allowance of RM71.7 million and higher investment income of RM38.1 million.Earnings per share was down slightly to 36.32 sen for 1QFY19 compared with 36.39 sen for 1QFY18.

533,"April 29, 2019 14:00 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Lead Story: Adopt trading strategy, experts advise","WITH the FBM KLCI falling to a two-year low of 1,619.73 last Thursday, in sharp contrast to the recovery seen in other equity markets in the region, a trading strategy is the way to go amid uncertainty on the domestic and external fronts.And if you think putting your money in fixed deposit is a good defensive strategy, the latest news on a potential downgrade of Malaysian bonds by FTSE Russell in its World Government Bond Index (WGBI) has sparked heavy selling in the local bond market, leading to a spike in the benchmark 10-year Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) yield to 3.94% last Thursday from 3.78% on Monday.The weaker performance of the FBM KLCI came amid a strong recovery in some of the small and mid-cap stocks during the first quarter following a sharp selldown towards the end of last year.Sectors such as construction and oil and gas (O&G) have rallied strongly despite the FBM KLCI’s underperformance. The technology sector is also back on investors’ radar screens after a lacklustre performance last year.But with 2018’s beaten down stocks already making a strong recovery in the first three months of the year, as well as the strong rally seen in the O&G and construction sectors, where are the trading opportunities?“We looked and analysed our coverage universe and see four strategies on the stocks we like, premised on market velocity (market cap churn) and volatility (share price volatility),” says MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman.The first strategy targets stocks with velocity above 40%, signalling that these counters are sufficiently liquid, with price volatility above 15%, giving what Redza calls a trading quadrant.“Some of the stocks we like in this category include MyEG Services Bhd, which is likely to continue its business albeit at a lower margin; Gabungan AQRS Bhd as a potential beneficiary of the East Coast Rail Link works as well as tracks passing through Kota Sultan Ahmad Shah township; Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd on its maintenance, construction and modification contracts and potential upside from Perdana Petroleum Bhd; and AirAsia Group Bhd for its strong load factor with higher percentage hedging for its fuel supplies to see more manageable costs,” he notes, adding that investors can easily buy and sell these counters given their high liquidity and defensive earnings with upside opportunities.MIDF Research sees counters with high volatility but lower velocity (below 40%) as an opportunistic play as well.“These strategies aim at counters that lack liquidity and have large price movements. It could be a good time to buy in when market sentiment turns negative,” Redza says, pointing to Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd, KKB Engineering Bhd (both are Sarawak plays) and MMC Corp Bhd (multi-utilities play).RHB Research Institute head of Malaysian research Alexander Chia, on the other hand, believes that rotational interest will still depend on developments in the external macro environment.“The easing of the ringgit and possibility of a US-China trade deal will see interest rotate back into the technology sector. The improvement in China’s economy will be positive for technology players, plantation companies, the aviation industry as well as the tourism sector,” Chia says.He believes that despite a strong rally seen in the construction sector as well as the Genting group, there is still upside in these stocks.“First-quarter results will be an important signpost for Genting as it will provide clarity on the uncertainty of the impact of the gaming tax. I think there will also be continued interest in the small and mid caps given the expensive large cap valuations,” Chia says.For the large caps, Chia believes the main uncertainty remains on whether there is more foreign portfolio selling to be done. “Big caps with high foreign shareholdings are unlikely to perform until the foreign selling abates,” he says.Indeed, a quick check reveals that foreign net selling continued until last Wednesday, although the exact amount was uncertain at the time of writing. Based on MIDF’s latest weekly fund flow report dated April 15 for the week ended April 12, Malaysia saw the largest foreign net outflow of the four Asean markets monitored, with a net outflow of RM2.05 billion on a year-to-date basis. In fact, out of the 15 weeks so far this year, international funds have been net sellers on Bursa for nine.Jeremy Goh, Hong Leong Investment Bank head of research, agrees that external uncertainties will play an important role and that investment angles in the upcoming quarters will be tilted towards an expectation that central banks around the world will continue to signal a dovish tone.“It is now a forgone conclusion that two of the key external uncertainties will persist into 2Q2019. A soft deadline for the US-China trade talks has been set for early May while Brexit has been extended to Oct 31. With these uncertainties extending into 2Q2019, we reckon that major central banks (US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank) will continue with their dovish tone. For Malaysia, while we do not expect an Overnight Policy Rate cut in the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting (May 6 and 7), we reckon that Bank Negara Malaysia will continue with a dovish tilt, similar to the March MPC tone,” Goh says.With dovish expectations, he points out that high-yielding dividend plays and real estate investment trusts (REITs) could garner interest.“We like IGB REIT among the large caps and MRCB-Quill REIT for small caps. For those seeking large-cap liquid yielders, we like Malayan Banking Bhd, which offers about a 6.5% yield. Other high dividend yielders that we favour include Bermaz Auto Bhd, Taliworks Corp Bhd and Lii Hen Industries Bhd, but those are within the small to mid-cap space,” Goh says.He adds that with the ringgit expected to end weaker in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, export plays should also be in favour. For export plays, the research house recommends Top Glove Corp Bhd.The ringgit is the worst-performing currency in Asia so far in April.Maybank Investment Bank Research head of research Wong Chew Hann agrees that the ringgit and interest rate direction will influence trading themes in the upcoming quarters.“Trading thematics to look out for in the second and third quarters include the ringgit’s direction and volatility, interest rate direction, high-yielding dividend stocks and more active enforcement against illegal ‘sin’ operators,” Wong says. Suggested trading themes•    Tech players, plantations, aviation, tourism, Genting group, construction•    High-yielding counters or REITs•    Export play on weaker ringgit•    Tech players on weaker ringgit and US-China trade deal•    Recovery of China’s economy — plantation, aviation, tourism•    Genting group — better clarity on impact of gaming tax from 1Q results•    Construction as mega infrastructure projects resume at lower cost•    Small to mid-cap space•    Stocks with high liquidity and price volatility — MyEG, Gabungan AQRS, Dayang, AirAsia•     Stocks with large price movements but lacking in liquidity — Cahya Mata Sarawak, KKB Engineering, MMC Corp ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-adopt-trading-strategy-experts-advise,"2019-05-01 20:08:28"

Only a fraction of the population can afford to have a personal coach, a therapist and a personal physician. The majority of Malaysians have to be in long queues and wait months to finally be able to sit down with a specialist to talk about their health and well-being.While Azran thought that the problem was prevalent, he did not have a solution back then. So, he kept this on the backburner until he visited some former university mates in San Francisco a few years ago.They were working for a company called Omada Health. It provided online coaching programmes to help everyday Americans prevent chronic health issues such as diabetes using a mix of behavioral science, user design and human interaction.“If you think about it, they were trying to solve the same problem that we had been trying to over at AirAsia X and iflix, that is, to provide the service to the mass market. When we started iflix, more than 100 investors rejected us because they said we did not stand a chance against Netflix,” says Azran.“What the investors did not realise was that these were not iflix’s target demographic, they were Netflix’s — those who love sophisticated English-language shows, which they watch on a big flat television screen in the living room with a fibre broadband connection of 100Mbps. That is not how 80% of Malaysians and 90% of Indonesians live. iflix created a product that people could watch on their phone with 3G connection and it provided more locally relevant content. That was how iflix scaled very rapidly.”This was very similar to Omada Health’s situation, he points out. The company was not trying to serve a specific population, it was trying to make better health more accessible to all. So, he took this as inspiration and tried to validate the idea back home by talking to key industry leaders.That was when Azran saw the statistics — chronic diseases are an unbridled double-digit growth expenditure. Although many parties have tried to bring costs down via prevention awareness campaigns, none have been significantly successful as the problem does not lie in awareness and education, he says.“The problem lies in the behaviour gap. When someone gets diagnosed by a doctor and told that he is diabetic, he is told to change his diet, manage his lifestyle, cut down on stress and take medications. But a whopping 74% of these people do not actually follow the advice. When they leave the hospital, there is no one stopping them from returning to their old lifestyles.“When they are home, there is no one stopping them from lighting another cigarette. Their physicians cannot do anything to prevent them from going out with their friends and hanging out at a mamak stall for supper and sugary drinks.”To solve this problem, Azran proposed setting up Naluri, a digital therapeutics service that assigns an individual a professional health coach who will check in with him regularly online. It also provides users with structured programmes that are personalised to their emotional, mental and physical needs. The goal is to help users achieve better health outcomes by building the necessary mental resilience to cope with their specific health challenges.Digital therapeutics is an emerging health discipline that uses technology to augment or even replace active drugs in disease treatment. According to non-profit trade association Digital Therapeutics Alliance, service providers deliver evidence-based therapeutic interventions to patients that are driven by high-quality software programmes to prevent, manage or treat medical disorders or diseases. These are used independently or in concert with medications, devices or other therapies to optimise patient care and health outcomes.A report released by PwC early this year revealed that investors poured a staggering US$12.5 billion into digital health ventures in 2017 and 2018. This was largely due to the digital therapeutics segment which, when paired with Internet of Things devices, has continued to see tremendous growth. Compared with 2013, this level of investment represents an increase of 230% in funding, says the report.With the aim of providing psychological help, Naluri started with a team of qualified psychologists who had been trained to deal with the pressures of chronic diseases and lifestyle changes, says Azran. “Most people tend to associate psychologists with clinical mental health disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. That is why there is a stigma. If they are diagnosed with cancer or heart disease, they do not think that they need psychological help.“Actually, they do need it. Their mental health is at risk and there is a very strong correlation between mental and physical health. If they are diagnosed with a chronic disease, they are likely to think about their situation, the possibility of losing their jobs, who will take care of their children or how their life is going to change.“Even if they are aware that they need psychological help, they are reluctant to get it because it is very uncomfortable for them to go out, meet someone and talk about it. The younger generation is more comfortable doing it online because there is a safe distance.”Another factor that makes digital sessions better than face-to-face ones is their regularity, he says. Normally, if one were to see a psychologist at a private hospital to lose weight, for example, they would need to attend 16 to 24 sessions worth RM300 each over a span of six months. Because these sessions are so far apart, it is hard for one to make significant progress, he adds.Naluri, on the other hand, costs less than RM150 a month for unlimited coaching sessions. Its professional team also briefly checks in with users every single day.While psychologists are good at motivation issues, some users do need very specific health and wellness advice that psychologists cannot help with. Acknowledging this, Azran brought in a team of medical specialists such as cardiologists, oncologists, pediatricians, family medicine specialists, obstetricians and gynaecologists as well as general practitioners.The Naluri app, meanwhile, comes with features such as a food journal, allowing users to easily track their food intake. Users do not need to count calories as the company’s dietitians will rate their efforts and give them feedback.Another handy feature is the thought journal, on which users can log their thought patterns and behaviours. Naluri’s coaches will also help users better understand themselves and assist them in coming up with steps to prevent negative recurrences.As the digital therapeutics concept is still new in Malaysia, it will take time before Naluri sees a significant take-up, says Azran. “It is like trying to sell retirement planning to Malaysians. It is really hard because they prefer to spend now and think later. That is why about 80% of Malaysians do not have enough to retire. It is like an uphill battle.”That is why the company works closely with insurers and corporate employers — two groups that are very concerned about the rising cost of chronic diseases. For insurers, offering Naluri’s service to its policyholders who have been diagnosed with a chronic disease is a risk mitigation measure. Those intending to purchase insurance who are deemed to be of higher risk could get the opportunity to enjoy lower premiums.“Actually, a lot of people today are rejected for insurance because by the time they want insurance, they are already overweight, hypertensive and their blood sugar is through the roof. What our insurance partners can do is go through the rejected customers and inform them that it will insure them and give them Naluri,” says Azran.“If they use Naluri and get healthier, the insurer will provide them with rebates. The healthier they are, the lower their premiums.” Betting on peopleApart from running Naluri, Azran Osman-Rani is an investor and adviser to a number of technology companies and start-ups, including video-on-demand service iflix (where he was previously its Malaysian CEO and group chief operating officer), financial technology (fintech) remittance company MoneyMatch, cognitive behavioural science firm Cognifyx and shipping and logistics player Yellow Porter.However, Azran says he is not a portfolio investor and he does not actively look for deals. Instead, he looks for the perfect team to bet on.“Start-ups are inherently risky. So normally, early-stage venture capitalists would take the portfolio approach. They would invest in more than 30 companies in the hope that two or three will give a good return on investment,” he says.“That is not how I do it. I do not invest in the business, I invest in founders. I only invest in founders I know well because I know their business plan will change in 6 to 12 months’ time. It is not about the merits of the business, it is about whether I believe these people have the ability to learn, pivot, adapt and grow. That is why I must know them personally.”Thus, Azran rejects a lot of investment and advisory requests he gets on sites such as LinkedIn. No matter how good a business idea sounds, he will not take the risk of investing in the company if he does not know the founders personally.For example, Azran met the founders of MoneyMatch when they first came up with the idea for the business. He mentored the team through WatchTower and Friends — the company’s first accelerator. He spent two years mentoring the team and observing how its business model had evolved over the years.“MoneyMatch’s original idea is nothing like its current business, which is remittance. Back then, the idea was that people do not want to use credit cards overseas because credit card companies charge exorbitant foreign exchange rates. That is why Malaysians will line up for an hour at MidValley Megamall’s currency exchange counters,” says Azran.“Initially, MoneyMatch wanted to match people who wanted to sell their excess foreign currency with people who wanted to buy it at a rate better than those offered by money changers. Today, its primary business is low-cost cross-border payments.”The same goes for Yellow Porter, he adds. Azran had worked with the company’s founder Vimal Kumar at both AirAsia X and iflix. That is the reason he believed the start-up would have a high chance of succeeding.“To me, the relationships matter a lot more than what the investment vehicle is. Also, I think it is best for people to invest in something they know well and have a passion for because they have to prepare for the downside of the investment,” says Azran.“If they are only investing for the money, they will get very stressed out when things go down. But if the product or investment is something they feel strongly about, they will find the energy to roll up their sleeves and work through the tough periods.”Although he is currently not looking to make new investments in start-ups, he still actively mentors budding entrepreneurs through accelerator platforms such as WatchTower and Friends, endeavor and Lean In.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/health-wealth-making-better-health-more-accessible-all,"2019-05-01 20:08:29"

Its passenger load factor stood at 88% in 1Q19, up one percentage point (ppt) from 1Q18.AirAsia said its capacity expansion, as measured by available seat kilometres (ASK), grew 11% y-o-y as the carrier added new routes and frequencies for both domestic and international routes to further grow its market share.Westports Holdings Bhd's net profit rose 13% to RM139.9 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019, from RM123.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. The higher net profit was attributed to a container tariff hike, effective from March 1, 2019.Earnings per share rose to 4.1 sen versus 3.63 sen previously.Quarterly revenue rose 7.8% to RM415.19 million from RM385.09 million a year ago, mainly attributed to double-digit growth in container volume and the implementation of container tariff hike since March 1.Seacera Group Bhd has been classified as a Practice Note 17 (PN17) company as it has defaulted on the payment of principal and profits to AmBank Islamic Bhd and not being able to provide a solvency declaration to Bursa Malaysia Securities.Seacera said it is looking into formulating a regularisation plan to address its PN17 status and will make the necessary announcement on the regularisation plan in due course.Seacera is now required to submit its regularisation plan to the Securities Commission Malaysia or Bursa Malaysia within the next 12 months, depending on whether the plan would significantly change its business direction.Maxis Bhd's new growth strategy gained momentum and drove its net profit 56% higher quarter-on-quarter to RM409 million on the back of revenue of RM2.23 billion.In its last quarter, Maxis said it had made significant changes to its long-term strategy, setting the foundation to be a strong converged solutions player in Malaysia.However, on a year-on-year basis, Maxis' net profit fell 22% to RM409 million or 5.2 sen per share for first quarter ended March 31, 2019 (1QFY19) from RM523 million or 6.7 sen per share, as the group suffered lower average revenue per user (Arpu) and termination of network sharing agreement.It said revenue was flat at RM2.23 billion for the quarter under review, compared with RM2.24 billion in the previous corresponding quarter.Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd posted a higher net loss of RM29.37 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2019 versus a net loss of RM25.27 million a year earlier, as work order materialisation has been slower than expected especially in the offshore-fabrication segment.The group said despite crude oil price stability, project sanctions and materialisation of work orders are slower than expected, hence affecting orderbook replenishment.Revenue was, however, higher at RM203.11 million versus RM188.28 million previously.LFE Corp Bhd has bagged two contracts worth RM50.2 million for sub-contract works in Johor.LFE said its wholly-owned subsidiary LFE Engineering Sdn Bhd has won an RM35 million contract from Innoseven Sdn Bhd to supply labour, equipment, tools, plant and machineries for the completion of an extension to a hospital in Segamat for 24 months.Separately, LFE Engineering has accepted an award from Seri Jaya Perkasa Sdn Bhd for an RM15.2 million job to supply the same for the construction of a new boarding school comprising 25 classrooms, a dining hall and a multi-purpose hall for Sekolah Menengah Sains Segamat.Gadang Holdings Bhd has purchased 20 million shares in DWL Resources Bhd for RM18 million in cash or 90 sen per share, in a bid to build and strengthen the business relationship between both companies.Gadang said the acquisition of the shares, which represented a 10.07% stake in DWL Resources, was done via a direct business transaction.Gadang's unit Gadang Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd had on April 18 entered into a pre-bid consortium agreement with Million Rich Development Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DWL, to work with each other to bid for infrastructure projects.They will jointly undertake a contract for such infrastructure works if their bids are successful.As promised to shareholders earlier, Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Bhd has declared a special one-off dividend of 32.6 sen per share, following its divestment of its 30%-stake in Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor Sdn Bhd (Splash).KPS said the dividend, totalling RM175.19 million, will be paid on May 28. The ex-date is May 13.The special dividend is in addition to the group's final dividend of 4.25 sen per share.Can-One Bhd’s subsidiary Can-One International Sdn Bhd now holds a 95.88% stake in Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd, giving it enough control of the company to compulsorily acquire the rest of the shares and delist Kian Joo.Kian Joo said it was informed that as at today, based on the valid acceptances, Can-One International holds 425.88 million shares or a 95.88% stake in Kian Joo.In addition, Can-One International has received valid acceptances of not less than nine-tenths in the value of Kian Joo shares (excluding the 34.52% stake already held by Can-One International).As such, Can-One International intends to invoke the provisions of Section 222(1) of the  Capital Market and Services Act, to compulsorily acquire the rest of Kian Joo shares for which acceptances have not been received.ManagePay Systems Bhd has entered into a joint venture and licensing agreement with MyTV Broadcasting Sdn Bhd to market and supply Hybrid Broadband Broadcasting Television (HbbTV) set top boxes, manage eCommerce on the HbbTV platform and ePayment solution services.ManagePay said it has also entered into an agreement with CoShip Technology to undertake the design, assembly, completion, supply and delivery of the set top boxes.The agreement with CoShip also includes the provision and performance of the warranty services, support and maintenance services and all necessary and incidental works and services so that the set top boxes are able to connect, interoperate, integrate or interface with the MYTV System.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/airasia-westports-seacera-maxis-mmhe-lfe-gadang-dwl-resources-kumpulan-perangsang-selangor,"2019-05-01 20:08:29"

547,"April 19, 2019 14:48 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Two grounded airlines in a decade cast doubt on India boom","MUMBAI (April 19): Jet Airways India Ltd, the second local carrier to ground its entire fleet in the past decade, is casting a shadow on India’s booming aviation sector.Once the nation’s biggest airline by market value, Jet Airways’ shares nosedived by a record 31% on Thursday in Mumbai after saying it would suspend operations on a “temporary” basis as it ran out of money. A severe cash crunch had pushed Vijay Mallya’s indebted Kingfisher Airlines Ltd to ground its planes in 2012. It never flew again and Mallya is still fighting his extradition to India from London.India’s aviation sector is an investment conundrum: it’s the world’s fastest-growing aviation market that has seen 54 consecutive months of double-digit percentage passenger growth and yet it’s notoriously difficult to make money in. As Jet Airways’ lenders race to find an investor for the debt-ravaged airline, suitors will weigh the sector’s prospects against India’s high jet-fuel prices and a crushing fare war worsened by the entry of no-frills carriers.“It’s a terrible setback for the entire industry. This makes the whole aviation story look doubtful,” said Parvez Damania, a Mumbai-based aviation expert. “Grounding of Jet Airways has impacted the credibility of double-digit growth of Indian civil aviation.”The crisis at Jet Airways that risks 23,000 jobs, has come at an exceptionally sensitive time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who’s seeking re-election in ongoing national elections, amid concerns on rising unemployment. The Modi administration has in the past few years cracked down hard on India’s delinquent borrowers to repair the books of banks that currently have the world’s worst soured loan ratio.“Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going,” the carrier said in an April 17 statement. “With immediate effect, Jet Airways is compelled to cancel all its international and domestic flights.”The carrier added that the decision was taken after a painstaking evaluation of all alternatives, with the ministries of civil aviation and finance and the aviation safety regulator informed in advance. It’ll continue to support a bid process initiated by lenders and that it aims to return to flying “as soon as possible.” That mechanism is due to conclude on May 10.‘Reasonably Hopeful’State Bank of India, on behalf of all Jet’s lenders, said in a Thursday statement that they had decided that “the best way forward for the survival of the carrier is to get the binding bids from potential investors” who were interested. Lenders are “reasonably hopeful” that the bid process is likely to be successful in determining a fair value for the carrier, it said.Lenders have asked the government to protect Jet’s prime airport slots to prevent an erosion of its value, Business Standard reported on Friday, citing sources it didn’t name.The banks are said to have shortlisted Etihad Airways PJSC, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, people familiar with the discussions said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.Potential investors in the beleaguered airline have asked lenders to take a haircut of as much as 80% on Jet’s debt, The Economic Times reported, citing unnamed sources.Jet’s financial problems are not new, according to Dharmesh Kant, head of retail research at Mumbai-based Indianivesh Securities Ltd. “It had been kicking the can down the road but sooner or later the time had to run out and it did,” he said over phone.Jet, which broke the monopoly of state-run Air India Ltd in the early 1990s, has been in decline since budget airlines started offering ultra-low fares that hurt profits and led it to pile up more than US$1 billion in debt. It also has unpaid dues to aircraft-leasing firms and employees including pilots, who have been agitating over non-payment of salaries.Jet’s founder Naresh Goyal resigned as chairman of the ailing airline last month, caving in to pressure from creditors. Goyal, who started in aviation as a ticketing agent, rose to be among the nation’s elite after Jet became India’s premier full service carrier.It won’t be an easy task for Jet’s new owner to turnaround the airline, which has reported losses for four straight quarters and in nine out of 11 last financial years. Grounding the airline means its value is going to erode further, making the revival tougher for any suitor.“With no aircraft, pilots, flight attendants and engineers, I certainly don’t see how any bidder will continue to see value in Jet Airways,” said Mark D Martin, founder of Martin Consulting. “History and our business dynamics prove that once an airline shuts down in India, it doesn’t restart.”Dirt-Cheap FaresIndian carriers, including Jet, have seen their profits hurt by the world’s highest jet-fuel taxes and a price war worsened by the entry of low-cost, no-frills airlines such as IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd that offered dirt-cheap fares with lower overheads.Foreign carriers from Malaysia’s low-cost AirAsia Group Bhd to Singapore Airlines Ltd and Jet’s minority shareholder Etihad, have all learnt how hard it is to make money in Indian skies.Air India, the state carrier, has been propped up on bailouts from the exchequer for years. AirAsia, which entered in 2014 with a vow to break even in four months, is still nowhere close to its goal. Vistara, Singapore Air’s joint venture with the Tata Group that started in 2015, has yet to make any money. SpiceJet had almost collapsed in 2014.The only exception in the sector is Indigo, run by Interglobe Aviation Ltd, which has reported annual profits since 2011 and whose stock has soared 33% this year. Spicejet, which has been on the mend, has also advanced as it leases more aircraft and starts more flights on the New Delhi-Mumbai route.Air fares are expected to rise in the coming weeks, possibly denting the passenger growth story that was making India the world’s quickest-growing aviation market. Jet’s decision to stop flying will also push the fares higher.Jet’s lenders could have done a bit more to keep the carrier up in the air, if only to preserve the value of the asset they have put on the block, according to Martin. “To think that no money was pumped in to resolve liabilities of lessors, fuelers and salaries is unforgiving,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/two-grounded-airlines-decade-cast-doubt-india-boom,"2019-05-01 20:08:35"

(April 18, RM2.43)
Maintain buy with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM3.40: AirAsia Group Bhd’s (AAGB) wholly-owned subsidiary AirAsia Investment Ltd together with Gumin Company Ltd and Hai Au Aviation Joint Stock Company have decided to terminate and release each other from all obligations under the transaction agreements of the proposed joint venture (JV) with effect from Wednesday. According to the initial plan, the formerly proposed new low-cost carrier in Vietnam was set to be launched in the third quarter of financial year 2019 (3QFY19).While the cancellation of the JV may appear to negatively impact AAGB’s expansion plan, we do not think that this is the case. In early April, AAGB introduced Can Tho to its network of routes with a weekly frequency of four flights. In fact, this is the first-ever international flight to Can Tho, indicating AAGB’s lead as an international airline for that destination. Can Tho is AAGB’s sixth destination in Vietnam, while new services between Bangkok and Can Tho are set to be commenced in May. With 8.5 million visitors visiting the Mekong Delta in 2018, we opine that this destination has the potential to attract more visitors which will positively flow into AAGB’s load factor. Therefore, it is not imperative for AAGB to set up a JV carrier in Vietnam.We maintain our FY19 and FY20 earnings estimates for AAGB as we did not impute any impact from the formerly proposed JV into our estimates. Moreover, AAGB did not make any financial commitments to the JV which would have cost RM58.2 million, representing a 30% stake in Hai Au Aviation Joint Stock Company.We maintain “buy” with an unchanged TP of RM3.40 per share, pegging its FY19 forecast earnings per share at a price-earnings ratio (PER) of 10 times. It is notable that AAGB is trailing at a PER of 4.1 times, while its Asian peers are approximately trading at a PER above 10 times which we opine is unwarranted given the group’s position as the leading Asean low-cost carrier. Based on our previous analysis of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (buy; TP: RM8.90) in our report on Monday, we opine that the proposed international departure levy will not have much impact on passenger growth. — MIDF Research, April 18",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cancellation-jv-lowcost-carrier-vietnam-unlikely-impact-airasia-group-expansion-plan,"2019-05-01 20:08:35"

We have to grab as much low-hanging fruit as we can within a short period of time.”Starting this year, G-AsiaPacific will venture into Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, followed by Singapore in its second phase of expansion. Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia could come after.“We have to spread our arms all over the Asean region. We want to give our potential competitors a run for their money. This game is about who gets there first to garner the market share,” says Lim, 61, who co-founded K-One in 2001.Last month, K-One completed the acquisition of a 60% stake in G-AsiaPacific for RM20.4 million cash. As a whole, the company is valued at RM34 million, representing eight times its annual profit guarantee of RM4.25 million.G-AsiaPacific is a fully integrated cloud advisory and brokerage firm founded by three technopreneurs — Goh Kiang Kiat, Goh Kiang Kian and Chen Kak Toong — in 2008.Lim acknowledges the trio could still grow G-AsiaPacific on their own but, by combining forces, K-One could take the company to the next level within a shorter time.“They were introduced to me by friends almost a year ago. I came to learn that they have done pretty well over the last 10 years, growing from a smallish firm to a medium-sized tech company today. They hope to take the company to greater heights, so we decided to do this.”Interestingly, K-One intends to acquire the remaining 40% of AsiaPacific as early as the second or third quarter of next year, through the issuance of K-One shares to the three founders.In the financial year ended Feb 28, 2018 (FY2018), G-AsiaPacific generated a profit of about RM4 million on revenue of RM17.5 million. Lim says the company has been profitable all along, but has only grown to a respectable size in recent years.“Today, everybody is jumping into the cloud computing space, including Alibaba and Tencent. Then there are Apple and IBM. Some of these companies are expecting cloud services to make the most money for them in the coming years. It is a very important space,” he says. Three main principalsAt the moment, G-AsiaPacific has three principals — Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft. When the time is right, the company aims to take on additional principals.“We are always exploring, we never close our doors. We might secure one or two new principals in the next two years,” says Lim.For perspective, G-AsiaPacific is a distributor for Amazon, Google and Microsoft. The company does not own any physical data and data centres. It helps the clients of the principals manage and migrate their data to the cloud, hosted by Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which own the data centres.“Most of the time, companies have their own in-house servers and back-up servers. But as they grow bigger, rather than storing the data in their own servers, they might as well put it up on the cloud,” says Lim.As for the principals, he says that their capital expenditure and working capital should reduce as they do not have to hire so many employees around the world. “Their preferred business model is to work with partners like us. We hire the technical staff, who will be trained by the principals, and our people do the migration and maintenance on their behalf. We even knock on doors and sign up clients for them.”Currently, G-AsiaPacific has over 3,000 customers in Malaysia, including AirAsia Bhd, Gamuda Land, IJM Corp, Malindo Air, Padini, Royal Selangor, Starbucks and Shiseido.“I believe Malaysians have started to realise the benefits of technology and the cloud, how it can help them to save costs,” says Lim.Following two consecutive years of losses, K-One returned to the black in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018), with a net profit of RM5.6 million on revenue of RM73 million.With G-AsiaPacific’s profit guarantee, Lim expects K-One, which has a market capitalisation of RM174.9 million,  to register strong double-digit revenue and profit growth for the next two years at the very least. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/kone-looking-cloud-pot-gold,"2019-05-01 20:08:42"

The monies recovered will be applied in accordance with section 201(7) of the CMSA, according to the posting the SC has put up on the website.The other three individuals found having taken advantage of insider information for trading purposes are former head of equity research at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd Terence Wong @ Huang Thar-Rearn, Abdul Radzim Abdul Rahman, who is the independent director of Amanah Investment, and Mohamed Radzif Mohamed Shamsudin.Wong also entered into a settlement with the SC amounting to RM573,150 for the same offence. He was noted to have acquired 800,000 MAS shares in July 2011. According to Reuters, CIMB was the adviser for the share swap deal.If not for the settlements, the SC would likely to have brought the matter to court for civil suits.    The insider trading is believed to have been linked to the proposed share swap deal that was unveiled in August 2011. MAS share price was on a roaster coaster ride then and its share price soared by as much as 28% in the days following the news. But the rally was short lived and the price then drifted lower.  To recap, in 2011, shareholders of MAS, AirAsia and AirAsia X Sdn Bhd (AAX) had proposed to enter into a share swap deal, originally intended to lend a helping hand to the loss-making national carrier.The agreement involved Khazanah Nasional Bhd (controlling shareholder of MAS) and Tune Air Sdn Bhd entering into a share swap agreement so that there will be cross-holding of shares resulting in Tune Air obtaining a 20.5% stake in then-listed MAS and Khazanah obtaining 10% in AirAsia.Kamarudin and Tan Sri Tony Fernandes are the owners of Tune Air.Both airlines also entered into a comprehensive collaboration framework. It was agreed that MAS was to be a full-service premium carrier, while AirAsia and AAX would be regional low-cost and medium-to-long haul low-cost carriers respectively.This was done in order to synergise the two Malaysian-based airlines and reduce competition against the national carrier.However, due to public outcry, the share swap deal was aborted eight months later.

The net result would be a squeeze on AirAsia's profit margins,"" he said.Yap added that with the squeeze in profitability, AirAsia will experience greater operating leverage from unexpected changes in fuel prices, exchange rates, competitive dynamics, and airport taxes and levies.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cimb-ib-research-expects-higher-operating-costs-gearing-levels-airasia-till-2021,"2019-05-01 20:08:51"

(April 1, 35 sen)
Maintain neutral with a revised target price (TP) of 34 sen (previously 33 sen). GD Express Carrier Bhd’s (GDEX) inked a strategic partnership with RedCargo Logistics Sdn Bhd (RedCargo), the cargo and logistics arm of AirAsia Group Bhd (AAGB) which begins on April 1, 2019. GDEX is not the first to form a partnership with RedCargo as Tasco Bhd was appointed the first direct logistics partner of RedCargo in January this year.The partnership enables GDEX to provide its customers with greater access by utilising AAGB’s network whereby goods can be transported efficiently on more than 5,000 weekly flights across the Asia-Pacific. GDEX in return would provide RedCargo with its last-mile services.With two logistics companies in partnership with RedCargo, we view that there is ample network capacity available to be booked by logistics partners. This bodes well for the growth in international parcel traffic which has been growing for the past three years. Apart from that, we do not discount the possibility of special rates being offered by AAGB to GDEX to attract more volume being channelled to the belly space of AAGB’s aircrafts. This in turn would incentivise GDEX to expand its services.RedCargo was incorporated in March last year as the exclusive provider of cargo capacity for AAGB. Therefore, we opine that the impact on GDEX earnings to be minimal at this juncture as it has yet to undergo its gestation period. As such we maintain our earnings estimates for financial years 2019 (FY19) and 2020 (FY20).The change in GDEX’s TP follows the higher revised terminal growth rate of 3% in our two-stage discounted cash flow model which reflects the growth in the Southeast Asian e-commerce industry which is expected to be worth US$102 billion by 2025.GDEX’s healthy balance sheet has supported the group’s various expansion plans. This includes acquisition of a 44.5% stake in SAP Express, an Indonesian courier company and ongoing effort to secure a partnership in Vietnam by the end of calendar year 2019  (CY2019) facilitated by Webbytes through its cloud-based point-of-sale platform. Nonetheless, we view that the earnings accretion from these ventures is yet to be meaningful given it is still in a gestation period. Meanwhile, valuation remains stretched at this juncture as compared to the average industry price-earnings ratio (PER) of about 15 times. All factors considered, we are maintaining our “neutral” stance at this juncture. In the long term, rerating catalysts for GDEX would be: (i) slowdown in growth for last-mile delivery start-up companies and (ii) stronger consumer-to-consumer business demand. — MIDF Research, April 1",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/redcargo-tieup-seen-incentivise-gdex-expand,"2019-05-01 20:08:57"

A study is being undertaken. We hope this can be implemented,” he told the Dewan Rakyat.Loke was responding to PAS deputy president Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man’s (PAS-Kubang Kerian) question on whether the government intends to streamline or combine all agencies involved in road-related laws into one to reduce overlaps.“We agree. If possible, the enforcement should be streamlined, so it is not disorderly. The public is sometimes unaware about which agency is undertaking the enforcement,” said Loke.Road laws are enforced by multiple federal agencies working separately on issues. For example, traffic laws come under the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM), vehicle modifications under the Road Transport Department and vehicle exhaust quality under the Department of Environment.Some overlaps are seen in traffic laws — for example, the PDRM and local councils issuing summons for traffic obstructions such as improper parking.On another matter, the Land Public Transport Agency (Apad) will be meeting e-hailing companies this week, said Loke, to iron out details on the operating licences for their drivers.“We have been in touch with [many] e-hailing companies. Most of [their drivers] have applied for the Public Service Vehicle (PSV) licence, and some of them got their approval,” said Loke.“A meeting between the Apad and e-hailing companies will be held this week,” he told reporters outside Dewan Rakyat yesterday.At end-2018, it was reported that all e-hailing drivers can undergo the PSV course beginning yesterday and obtain their licences — similar with the requirement for existing taxi drivers.The PSV licence is compulsory for all e-hailing drivers beginning July this year. It has been reported that the PSV training modules take six hours to complete, at a fee capped at RM200.In September last year, Loke said Malaysia has about 200,000 e-hailing drivers, three-quarters of whom are part-time drivers — compared with 60,000 registered taxi drivers nationwide.On a different matter, Loke said no airline has proposed to the ministry to develop airports in the country. “There is no airline applying to develop airports.

Yes, it’s back next year","Just the other day, someone asked me if I knew that next year is Visit Malaysia Year (VMY). Lamenting the apparent lack of promotions, he pointed out that time is running out.“There are no signboards at the airport or key tourist spots in the city to say 2020 is Visit Malaysia Year,” said the former corporate executive turned tour guide. He recalled his early days at Malaysia Airlines when the national carrier would play its part to promote the event by painting “Visit Malaysia Year” on the sides of its planes. That hasn’t happened yet. Perhaps we can do more now that we have AirAsia and Malindo Air as well, apart from Malaysia Airlines.Come to think of it, I have not noticed any commercial on radio or TV, or any billboard promoting VMY 2020, as I travel to and from work.No VMY 2020 ads popping up either when I watch YouTube or my favourite Korean drama on the net. No song telling me that to know Malaysia is to love Malaysia or why Malaysia is truly Asia — or its equivalent — has been heard over the airwaves.In fact, determining when the tourism ministry will start its VMY 2020 campaign is almost as difficult as guessing when Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber plan to hold a wedding ceremony for their family and friends.The clock is ticking, but the ministry has yet to reveal the full line-up of events.In fact, the last time there was a lot of publicity about VMY 2020 was in January last year when the logo featuring the two mascots — an orangutan and a proboscis monkey wearing sunglasses and grinning — came under fire from netizens because of the amateurish design. Then, fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on who you talk to), we got caught up in the 14th general election, which saw a change of government. We also got a new tourism minister in July. These distractions gave Wira the orangutan and the proboscis monkey a reprieve until recently, when a contest to redesign the logo was held. It will take another month before a winner is announced.VMY used to be something that people from the local travel trade would look forward to. The promotions would begin a year earlier with a series of year-long special events and activities. The celebrations would culminate with the Independence Day parade on Aug 31. The success of the first VMY in 1990 spurred another in 1994, and in 2007. The last time VMY was held was 2014. In fact, some of our regional rivals had become worried over our aggressive promotion of tourism.Indeed, the ministry’s efforts have helped push tourism from being the country’s fifth largest foreign-exchange earner in 1990 to second largest today, after manufacturing. The number of foreign visitors reached 25.3 million last year from 7.4 million in 1990. Spending by tourists amounted to RM84.1 billion last year from RM4.5 billion in 1990.Perhaps Malaysia should consider taking a leaf out of South Korea’s book. The East Asian country has done a great job boosting its tourism through its music, TV dramas and films. The seven-member Korean boy band BTS is, to date, the most successful manifestation of the Korean wave. Hyundai Research Institute estimates that the band contributes US$3.6 billion to the South Korean economy annually. That works out to roughly 17% of our tourism receipts.Perhaps the ministry has a lot of promotional activities up its sleeve and is just waiting for the right moment to build up the momentum towards VMY 2020. Until then, I have my Korean dramas to keep me entertained.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/coffee-break-remember-visit-malaysia-year-yes-its-back-next-year,"2019-05-01 20:08:58"

583,"March 29, 2019 14:00 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Special Report: Saving Malaysia Airlines, again","SHOULD the government choose to shut it down, Malaysia Airlines Bhd will go down as the first national airline in Asia to go bust (Japan Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after two years), joining the ranks of its European counterparts such as Sabena, Air Berlin, Alitalia and Cyprus Airways.The flag carrier, which saw Khazanah Nasional Bhd pay RM1.38 billion to take it private in August 2014 and reboot it into a smaller airline under its current name in September 2015, is once again facing an uncertain future after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad remarked last week that shutting it down was one option being considered by the government. Selling the national asset and refinancing its debts are two other possibilities the government will explore, he said.The prime minister’s warning comes as calls for the beleaguered airline to be wound down intensified in the past few weeks. The airline’s woes flared up on March 5 after its sole shareholder Khazanah reported its first annual loss in over a decade, mainly due to a RM3.7 billion writedown of Malaysia Airlines’ value last year.It doesn’t help matters that the airline missed its target to return to the black last year and, according to Centre for Aviation (CAPA) chief analyst and chief representative for Southeast Asia Brendan Sobie, will find it difficult to achieve profitability, at least in the near future, given current market conditions.On March 1, the private company revealed that it finished 2018 with a marginally lower loss compared to a year ago but it did not disclose the figures.Filings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) show that Malaysia Airlines’ net loss increased by 85% year on year to RM812.11 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY2017). It has lost RM2.35 billion between 2015 and 2017.While it did not disclose its exact revenue for FY2018 except to say that it grew by 1% y-o-y, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that revenue rose to RM8.76 billion from RM8.67 billion in FY2017. It has yet to file its financial statements for FY2018 with SSM.Malaysia Airlines blamed FY2018’s poor performance on crew shortage, intense competition, oversupply of capacity and volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange.It is worth noting that when the 12-point MAS Recovery Plan (MRP) was conceived in 2014, fuel price was US$75.68 per barrel. As at March 8, 2019, the International Air Transport Association jet fuel price monitor was up 3.5% at US$80.30 per barrel from a year ago.The ringgit had also weakened by 3.6% to 4.9% to 4.0910 against the US dollar last Thursday. Khazanah’s assumption under the five-year recovery plan was that the local currency would range from 3.90 to 3.95.Still, critics point to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, which turned things around with a HK$2.3 billion profit last year after three years of heavy losses and Singapore Airlines (SIA), which managed to turn in a net profit of S$284 million for the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, amid the challenging operating environment. Khazanah seen more willing to give up the flag carrierAfter not one but four failed attempts at restructuring the national carrier and setting it on a path to sustainable profitability, including during the 42 years when it was known as Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), the calls are growing louder for the government to shut it down for good.Its weak financial health — even after a RM6 billion injection from Khazanah in 2014 — also makes it a prime target when Malaysia’s new government is looking to trim its huge debt of RM1.087 trillion as at Dec 31, 2018.Indeed, some analysts say the timing of Khazanah’s RM3.7 billion impairment charge on Malaysia Airlines in 2018 is an indication that it may be ready to end or sell its loss-making unit.HLIB Research aviation analyst Daniel Wong notes that Malaysia Airlines is not part of Khazanah’s core portfolio, suggesting that the state investment firm would be willing to part with its airline business if the investment does not make financial sense and assuming government approval is granted.“While we do not doubt Malaysia Airlines is a pride to Malaysia as the national carrier has been around since 1947, we remain doubtful of Khazanah’s willingness and ability to sustain the continued losses of Malaysia Airlines. The losses of Malaysia Airlines may amount to RM1 billion per year,” he says in a March 13 report. Malaysia Airlines can still fly highOnce-troubled flag carriers such as British Airways (BA), Japan Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Qantas Airways are living proof that Malaysia Airlines still has a chance of turning around, says a senior aviation consultant who declined to be named.A multitude of factors have contributed to Malaysia Airlines’ financial woes, but foremost among them is the lack of autonomy to run the business without government intervention, say airline experts and analysts.“There are no obvious or easy solutions and there are so many external factors that will impact Malaysia Airlines’ future financials. However, there are areas for potential improvement,” CAPA’s Sobie tells The Edge.“While the latest restructuring went much deeper than previous attempts, it didn’t go deep enough and address all the legacy issues. The airline could potentially take another crack at reducing its costs but this can only be effective if there is no political interference.“It could also relook its commercial and network strategy. Evolving into more of a regional airline could be an option,” he says.Sobie points out that while shutting down the airline is obviously politically difficult and has never really been an option, it now seems that it is being seriously considered.“There would still be sufficient competition in the market (even with Malaysia Airlines gone) and the void would likely be filled by the existing or new competitors. Keep in mind there were only two (Malaysia-based) players (Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia Group Bhd) before Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd was launched five years ago. However, another restructuring would still likely be the preferred option politically,” he adds.Transport infrastructure consultancy Modalis Infrastructure Partners associate director Khair Mirza believes Malaysia Airlines can thrive given a level playing field.“By definition, GLCs (government-linked companies) need to play a dual role. So, as long as it has a level playing field against other carriers, it can succeed, like how Qantas, Turkish Airlines and Garuda have all succeeded,” he adds.Khair points out that Malaysia Airlines is the only recognised strategic GLC that faces unfettered competition while trying to balance a social equity role. “It’s like asking an elephant to climb up a coconut tree just because the monkey has glorified climbing trees.”Meanwhile, a senior aviation consultant notes that the government must also ensure that Malaysia Airlines has the right people on its board of directors to steer the airline.“The board has had many of the same members for several years despite losses. It is good to have new people with fresh ideas to help move Malaysia Airlines forward.“It is also good to have a combination of some with overall airline industry experience (at least two to three years) and some good professionals in finance and law,” he adds.The consultant also points out that the airline must have the right people in senior management. “Malaysia Airlines CEO Izham Ismail should be given a chance to carry on and he deserves the freedom to name his own team,” he says.Modalis’ Khair concurs, noting that a shake-up of the eight-member board is long overdue.He also believes that it is time to allow Malaysia Airlines to award contracts based on competitive bidding rather than “giving contracts to non-strategic investees that have bloated into public-listed entities, squeezing out bona fide market participants”. A case in point is the RM42.99 million three-year contract bagged by UEM Edgenta Bhd’s 80%-owned subsidiary KFM Holdings Bhd in June 2016 to provide facility management services to Malaysia Airlines via direct negotiation.A check on Malaysia Airlines website reveals that its board comprises one executive director —  Izham — and seven non-executive directors, namely Tan Sri Krishnan Tan Boon Seng, Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, David Lau Nai Pek, Dr Mohamadon Abdullah, Sheranjiv M Sammanthan, Mohammad Izani Ashari and Ahmad Zulqarnain Che Onn. Foo Shiou Voon is an alternative director for Mohammad Izani.Tan, Lau, Mohamadon and Mohammad Izani have been on the board since August 2015. Tan, Lau and Mohamadon were also directors at the old MAS.An accountant by training, Tan is currently non-executive deputy chairman of IJM Corp Bhd. Zamzamzairani served as the group CEO and managing director of Telekom Malaysia Bhd from April 2008 to April 2017, while Lau has over 35 years of experience in finance and is also a director of Axiata Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Mohamadon had served MAS for 32 years before retiring on Dec 31, 2004, as senior general manager of corporate services.Meanwhile, four board members — Sheranjiv, Mohammad Izani, Ahmad Zulqarnain and Foo — are Khazanah appointees. Asset sales may offer some reliefHLIB Research’s Wong believes it will be wise for the government to divest Malaysia Airlines or find a strategic partner instead of shutting it down, which will stem the draining of government cash while reducing staff layoff, as the takeover entity will still need a workforce to run the airline.Malaysia Airlines has undergone two rounds of layoffs in the last 13 years. It shed over 6,000 employees in 2006 and 2007 under the Business Turnaround Plan 1 and another 6,000 in 2015 under the MRP. Today. it has a 13,000-strong workforce, which some still consider bloated given its smaller network.A former Malaysia Airlines senior executive says the government should take a leaf from the sale of a 49.9% stake in national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd to Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.“There won’t be any government interference in the management of the business then.“The entire board and key personnel of Malaysia Airlines must also be replaced. They had the opportunity to revive the airline, but failed. Let others in the private sector (preferably Malaysian) to fix this. It can be done,” he says.“The problems in Malaysia Airlines are obvious; we need the ‘will’ to do it. The government needs to let go of the national airline and let the private sector run it entirely, just like BA and Iberia,” he adds.He is also of the view that Malaysia Airlines’ business units like cargo, engineering, flight catering, ground handling and the loyalty programme should be transformed from cost centres to profit centres where they are responsible for their own revenues, costs and resulting profits.“These units should be looked at as standalone businesses. They  can then grow and expand without being held back by the passenger business.”Malaysia Airlines’ FY2017 financial statements show that its cargo revenue stood at just RM551.27 million, a far cry from the RM1.66 billion reported in FY2013.Its engineering services business has also been scaled down from a world-renowned player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul market under MAS Aerospace Engineering to a purely self-supporting unit today. Airport handling and engineering services revenue stood at RM49.34 million in FY2017 compared with RM256.86 million in FY2013. Note:Following the publication of this story, UEM Edgenta Bhd has clarified that Malaysia Airlines Bhd had conducted an open tender process for the RM42.99 million three-year facility management services contract covering specific parts of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and its Kelana Jaya academy in Petaling Jaya, and not via direct negotiation as reported.The open tender process saw the participation of several facility management service providers including KFM Holdings Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of UEM Edgenta, UEM Edgenta said in a statement.It noted that Malaysia Airlines undertook a request for information in May 2015, followed by a request for proposal in July 2015 and commercial clarification.""In the final round, KFM along with two other facilities management service providers were shortlisted. KFM was informed of the contract award in February 2016 and it was completed in December 2018,"" it said.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/special-report-saving-malaysia-airlines-again,"2019-05-01 20:09:00"

Nationwide, the group currently employs 4,000 people, and wants to raise the number to 5,200 in four years.He said Asia-Pacific is seeing a higher passenger traffic growth, which is expected to boost demand for aircraft production and MRO services.“We expect annual growth in passenger traffic of 5.5% a year in Asia-Pacific, compared with 4.4% worldwide. Asia-Pacific is growing faster than the rest of the world, hence why we’re seeing a growth,” said Nasr, adding the trend is expected to continue for 20 years.This is why the group remains “100% committed to growing our presence in Malaysia, firmly believing the country’s aerospace industry’s potential to become one of the largest in the region”, according to Nasr.Airbus Malaysia country head Raymond Lim, also the chief executive officer of Airbus’ wholly-owned MRO outfit — Sepang Aircraft Engineering Sdn Bhd — said the region’s estimated need of about 20,000 aircraft in 20 years, versus its current 7,000 aircraft, would boost MRO operations and drive demand for more skilled workers.Lim also said the group is seeking to grow its helicopter MRO segment by conducting more complex MRO works via its helicopter unit here, Airbus Helicopters Malaysia Sdn Bhd. “We have made a significant investment in making Airbus Helicopters a complex repair centre for the region.”He cited the group’s new helicopter completion and delivery centre here is set to open in May, and that the group is looking to produce 20 helicopters a year from the centre.On the group’s order book, Airbus Asia Pacific head of communications Sean Lee said Airbus now has 727 aircraft orders in Malaysia, of which 278 planes have been delivered.Of the total, AirAsia has ordered 592 aircraft, AirAsia X (96) and Malaysia Airlines (39). Of these, 219 units have been delivered to AirAsia, 20 to AirAsia X, and all 39 to Malaysia Airlines.Malaysia is Airbus’ largest supply base in Southeast Asia, and the group’s fifth-largest supply base for composite parts globally, according to Nasr.

Its share price plunged as much as 10.3% to an intraday low of RM6.90 but it managed to recoup some losses to close at a two-year low of RM7.33.Investment analysts were puzzled with the fierce selling given that most of them, who track the airport operator, are recommending the stock to clients.According to Bloomberg data, the counter has 14 “buy” calls, six “hold” calls, and one “sell” call, with consensus target price (TP) at RM9.33.Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng commented that investors could be overreacting to the news flow, which he cautioned that several uncertainties have cast a shadow on the airport operator.“There are some uncertainties surrounding MAHB, as the government is looking into new ways to operate airports in Malaysia, [and] there is also this RM400 million litigation between MAHB and AirAsia X Bhd,” said Ang.The news flow related to MAHB has been non-stop in recent months. It started off with the proposal in Budget 2019 on [the] setting up [of] an airport real estate investment trust, followed by Transport Minister Anthony Loke indicating that the government was mulling lowering the passenger service charge (PSC) to make air travel more affordable. The airport operator later got into a legal dispute with AirAsia X.The most recemt news is that the government has confirmed allowing a third party to build and operate a new airport in Kulim, Kedah. Such news is perceived by some quarters as a move to liberalise the airport management business, which is currently dominated by MAHB.Meanwhile, MAHB is in the midst of negotiating with the government for a regulatory asset base framework, which would outline a new ceiling price for the PSC that commensurates with the required capital expenditure by the airport operator in future.Yesterday, Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali stressed that the government can no longer afford to build airports even though there is a need for them. “With participation of the private sector, we need to have a new framework to regulate their participation in developing airports,” he said.However, Maybank Investment Bank aviation analyst Mohshin Aziz pointed out that MAHB’s share price has not moved much last week when the government announced that it would allow the private sector to build a new airport in Kulim.“It was strange ... many people have called to ask me about the sudden selldown,” said Mohshin when contacted but he added that there was no new selling impetus yesterday.MAHB share price has been dropping since August last year, down 25% from a high of RM9.80.

596,"March 22, 2019 18:07 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Why does Malaysia Airlines keep failing — and is there a way to stop it?","SHOULD the government choose to shut it down, Malaysia Airlines Bhd will go down as the first national airline in Asia to go bust (Japan Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after two years), joining the ranks of its European counterparts such as Sabena, Air Berlin, Alitalia and Cyprus Airways.The flag carrier, which saw Khazanah Nasional Bhd pay RM1.38 billion to take it private in August 2014 and reboot it into a smaller airline under its current name in September 2015, is once again facing an uncertain future after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad remarked last week that shutting it down was one option being considered by the government. Selling the national asset and refinancing its debts are two other possibilities the government will explore, he said.The prime minister’s warning comes as calls for the beleaguered airline to be wound down intensified in the past few weeks. The airline’s woes flared up on March 5 after its sole shareholder Khazanah reported its first annual loss in over a decade, mainly due to a RM3.7 billion writedown of Malaysia Airlines’ value last year.It doesn’t help matters that the airline missed its target to return to the black last year and, according to Centre for Aviation (CAPA) chief analyst and chief representative for Southeast Asia Brendan Sobie, will find it difficult to achieve profitability, at least in the near future, given current market conditions.On March 1, the private company revealed that it finished 2018 with a marginally lower loss compared to a year ago but it did not disclose the figures.Filings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) show that Malaysia Airlines’ net loss increased by 85% year on year to RM812.11 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY2017). It has lost RM2.35 billion between 2015 and 2017.While it did not disclose its exact revenue for FY2018 except to say that it grew by 1% y-o-y, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that revenue rose to RM8.76 billion from RM8.67 billion in FY2017. It has yet to file its financial statements for FY2018 with SSM.Malaysia Airlines blamed FY2018’s poor performance on crew shortage, intense competition, oversupply of capacity and volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange.It is worth noting that when the 12-point MAS Recovery Plan (MRP) was conceived in 2014, fuel price was US$75.68 per barrel. As at March 8, 2019, the International Air Transport Association jet fuel price monitor was up 3.5% at US$80.30 per barrel from a year ago.The ringgit had also weakened by 3.6% to 4.9% to 4.0910 against the US dollar last Thursday. Khazanah’s assumption under the five-year recovery plan was that the local currency would range from 3.90 to 3.95.Still, critics point to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, which turned things around with a HK$2.3 billion profit last year after three years of heavy losses and Singapore Airlines (SIA), which managed to turn in a net profit of S$284 million for the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, amid the challenging operating environment. Khazanah seen more willing to give up the flag carrierAfter not one but four failed attempts at restructuring the national carrier and setting it on a path to sustainable profitability, including during the 42 years when it was known as Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), the calls are growing louder for the government to shut it down for good.Its weak financial health — even after a RM6 billion injection from Khazanah in 2014 — also makes it a prime target when Malaysia’s new government is looking to trim its huge debt of RM1.087 trillion as at Dec 31, 2018.Indeed, some analysts say the timing of Khazanah’s RM3.7 billion impairment charge on Malaysia Airlines in 2018 is an indication that it may be ready to end or sell its loss-making unit.HLIB Research aviation analyst Daniel Wong notes that Malaysia Airlines is not part of Khazanah’s core portfolio, suggesting that the state investment firm would be willing to part with its airline business if the investment does not make financial sense and assuming government approval is granted.“While we do not doubt Malaysia Airlines is a pride to Malaysia as the national carrier has been around since 1947, we remain doubtful of Khazanah’s willingness and ability to sustain the continued losses of Malaysia Airlines. The losses of Malaysia Airlines may amount to RM1 billion per year,” he says in a March 13 report. Malaysia Airlines can still fly highOnce-troubled flag carriers such as British Airways (BA), Japan Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Qantas Airways are living proof that Malaysia Airlines still has a chance of turning around, says a senior aviation consultant who declined to be named.A multitude of factors have contributed to Malaysia Airlines’ financial woes, but foremost among them is the lack of autonomy to run the business without government intervention, say airline experts and analysts.“There are no obvious or easy solutions and there are so many external factors that will impact Malaysia Airlines’ future financials. However, there are areas for potential improvement,” CAPA’s Sobie tells The Edge.“While the latest restructuring went much deeper than previous attempts, it didn’t go deep enough and address all the legacy issues. The airline could potentially take another crack at reducing its costs but this can only be effective if there is no political interference.“It could also relook its commercial and network strategy. Evolving into more of a regional airline could be an option,” he says.Sobie points out that while shutting down the airline is obviously politically difficult and has never really been an option, it now seems that it is being seriously considered.“There would still be sufficient competition in the market (even with Malaysia Airlines gone) and the void would likely be filled by the existing or new competitors. Keep in mind there were only two (Malaysia-based) players (Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia Group Bhd) before Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd was launched five years ago. However, another restructuring would still likely be the preferred option politically,” he adds.Transport infrastructure consultancy Modalis Infrastructure Partners associate director Khair Mirza believes Malaysia Airlines can thrive given a level playing field.“By definition, GLCs (government-linked companies) need to play a dual role. So, as long as it has a level playing field against other carriers, it can succeed, like how Qantas, Turkish Airlines and Garuda have all succeeded,” he adds.Khair points out that Malaysia Airlines is the only recognised strategic GLC that faces unfettered competition while trying to balance a social equity role. “It’s like asking an elephant to climb up a coconut tree just because the monkey has glorified climbing trees.”Meanwhile, a senior aviation consultant notes that the government must also ensure that Malaysia Airlines has the right people on its board of directors to steer the airline.“The board has had many of the same members for several years despite losses. It is good to have new people with fresh ideas to help move Malaysia Airlines forward.“It is also good to have a combination of some with overall airline industry experience (at least two to three years) and some good professionals in finance and law,” he adds.The consultant also points out that the airline must have the right people in senior management. “Malaysia Airlines CEO Izham Ismail should be given a chance to carry on and he deserves the freedom to name his own team,” he says.Modalis’ Khair concurs, noting that a shake-up of the eight-member board is long overdue.He also believes that it is time to allow Malaysia Airlines to award contracts based on competitive bidding rather than “giving contracts to non-strategic investees that have bloated into public-listed entities, squeezing out bona fide market participants”. A case in point is the RM42.99 million three-year contract bagged by UEM Edgenta Bhd’s 80%-owned subsidiary KFM Holdings Bhd in June 2016 to provide facility management services to Malaysia Airlines via direct negotiation.A check on Malaysia Airlines website reveals that its board comprises one executive director —  Izham — and seven non-executive directors, namely Tan Sri Krishnan Tan Boon Seng, Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, David Lau Nai Pek, Dr Mohamadon Abdullah, Sheranjiv M Sammanthan, Mohammad Izani Ashari and Ahmad Zulqarnain Che Onn. Foo Shiou Voon is an alternative director for Mohammad Izani.Tan, Lau, Mohamadon and Mohammad Izani have been on the board since August 2015. Tan, Lau and Mohamadon were also directors at the old MAS.An accountant by training, Tan is currently non-executive deputy chairman of IJM Corp Bhd. Zamzamzairani served as the group CEO and managing director of Telekom Malaysia Bhd from April 2008 to April 2017, while Lau has over 35 years of experience in finance and is also a director of Axiata Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Mohamadon had served MAS for 32 years before retiring on Dec 31, 2004, as senior general manager of corporate services.Meanwhile, four board members — Sheranjiv, Mohammad Izani, Ahmad Zulqarnain and Foo — are Khazanah appointees. Asset sales may offer some reliefHLIB Research’s Wong believes it will be wise for the government to divest Malaysia Airlines or find a strategic partner instead of shutting it down, which will stem the draining of government cash while reducing staff layoff, as the takeover entity will still need a workforce to run the airline.Malaysia Airlines has undergone two rounds of layoffs in the last 13 years. It shed over 6,000 employees in 2006 and 2007 under the Business Turnaround Plan 1 and another 6,000 in 2015 under the MRP. Today. it has a 13,000-strong workforce, which some still consider bloated given its smaller network.A former Malaysia Airlines senior executive says the government should take a leaf from the sale of a 49.9% stake in national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd to Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.“There won’t be any government interference in the management of the business then.“The entire board and key personnel of Malaysia Airlines must also be replaced. They had the opportunity to revive the airline, but failed. Let others in the private sector (preferably Malaysian) to fix this. It can be done,” he says.“The problems in Malaysia Airlines are obvious; we need the ‘will’ to do it. The government needs to let go of the national airline and let the private sector run it entirely, just like BA and Iberia,” he adds.He is also of the view that Malaysia Airlines’ business units like cargo, engineering, flight catering, ground handling and the loyalty programme should be transformed from cost centres to profit centres where they are responsible for their own revenues, costs and resulting profits.“These units should be looked at as standalone businesses. They  can then grow and expand without being held back by the passenger business.”Malaysia Airlines’ FY2017 financial statements show that its cargo revenue stood at just RM551.27 million, a far cry from the RM1.66 billion reported in FY2013.Its engineering services business has also been scaled down from a world-renowned player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul market under MAS Aerospace Engineering to a purely self-supporting unit today. Airport handling and engineering services revenue stood at RM49.34 million in FY2017 compared with RM256.86 million in FY2013. Note:Following the publication of this story, UEM Edgenta Bhd has clarified that Malaysia Airlines Bhd had conducted an open tender process for the RM42.99 million three-year facility management services contract covering specific parts of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and its Kelana Jaya academy in Petaling Jaya, and not via direct negotiation as reported.The open tender process saw the participation of several facility management service providers including KFM Holdings Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of UEM Edgenta, UEM Edgenta said in a statement.It noted that Malaysia Airlines undertook a request for information in May 2015, followed by a request for proposal in July 2015 and commercial clarification.""In the final round, KFM along with two other facilities management service providers were shortlisted. KFM was informed of the contract award in February 2016 and it was completed in December 2018,"" it said.For related story, see: Overcapacity sends Malaysia Airlines further into turbulence",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/why-does-malaysia-airlines-keep-failing-%E2%80%94-and-there-way-stop-it,"2019-05-01 20:09:09"

The flag carrier has been losing cash for years. Now, the country's prime minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, is asking if it should fly at all. State meddling has hampered a turnaround and there’s too much local capacity. Folding the airline would send a message that he is serious about reducing government's stifling role in business.The group was in trouble even before the disappearance of MH370 five years ago, and the loss of flight MH17 months later. Bailed out more than once, it had been racking up losses since 2011 when it was finally taken private by respected sovereign wealth fund Khazanah in a RM6 billion (US$1.5 billion) rescue.Unfortunately, a turnaround has proved elusive: Malaysia Airlines has had three CEOs in four years. Low-cost rival AirAsia now has more than twice the local market share and recorded increased 2018 earnings. In the same period, Malaysia Airlines made a loss, and filled a lower percentage of seats. And Khazanah is being dragged down too, posting a loss in 2018 because of the carrier.The biggest obstacle may be politics. Take the company’s purchase of A380s: the aircraft were bought in 2003, apparently to keep up with its Singaporean rival. The planes proved impossible to fill — they needed to go. But their ownership by government companies limited flexibility, according to aviation consultancy CAPA, even while other leases were renegotiated under quasi-bankruptcy protection after 2014.Flag carriers are about prestige, and closing them is painful, not least given the 12,000 or so employees. The carrier’s sovereign owner has commissioned a study into the turnaround of Japan Airlines, according to a person familiar with the situation, but that won’t help. That was a return from outrageous 1980s exuberance, and when low-cost seat capacity was under half what it is now.It may simply be too late. After all, back in 2014, Malaysia Airlines only really had one domestic rival and still struggled. If the carrier is wound up, capacity would likely drop only temporarily, as others like Malindo Air could snap up the slots. For a government which says it wants to pull back state ownership, that would at least send a strong message.CONTEXT NEWS Clara Ferreira-Marques is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

So if you do not have that consistency in an organisation, then this raises doubts [among stakeholders].“So, a balance has to be struck — the person whose face is on the front is the leader, but it is the organisation which [provides support], so it is not just what the leader says but how the group behaves as well,” he adds.That said, the onus of building confidence — or renewing it, as the case may be — lies with a company’s management that is often seen as its face as well.And the leader needs the backing of the organisation to be successful in doing that, says Sri.“The tone at the top needs to be set, essentially, to say ‘we need to promote integrity at the highest levels all the way through the organisation’,” he tells The Edge.“However, it is not just about rolling out a plan or initiative; it is how you see it through, from the actions to the enforcement of it [throughout the organisation],” he adds.The growing spotlight on the role of leadership in trust is accorded consideration in the PwC Malaysia Building Trust Awards, which returns this year for the third time since its inaugural edition back in 2015.The biennial awards recognise companies that are making significant moves in building integrity through their communications and interactions with stakeholders.To recap, no submissions or nominations are accepted for the awards. Instead, only the top 50 Malaysian public-listed companies (PLCs) on Bursa Malaysia by market capitalisation are considered.The annual reports of these 50 companies are then benchmarked against the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework (refer to Methodology). This would be based on the latest available annual reports as of June 2018. Following this, a total of 20 companies are then shortlisted. For this year, the 20 finalists listed in alphabetical order are: AirAsia Group Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, BIMB Holdings Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Digi.com Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, KLCCP Stapled Group, Malayan Banking Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Maxis Bhd, MISC Bhd, Petronas, RHB Bank Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Sunway Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.PwC Malaysia assurance and people partner Pauline Ho says on top of the existing assessment methodology, an additional survey was introduced this year as part of three dimensions of measuring trust perception in collaboration with The Iclif Leadership and Governance Centre (Iclif).According to Ho, the extra survey looks at trust in leadership as the first dimension. The review is designed for an organisation’s employees to answer questions surrounding leadership and their confidence in their company’s leadership team.For the second dimension, PwC conducts an independent survey via a third party to comb through online sources of data for conversations about trust on the 20 shortlisted organisations in order to build a trust profile for each.“The third dimension is a public poll, which is open to the public until March 31, 2019, where we get anyone who is not working within the organisation to comment on whether these [companies] are building trust,” says Ho.“[Through this] we have these different perspectives so that we not only listen to what the companies say about themselves, but also what employees think about their leadership and what the third parties are saying, as well as the public opinion,” Ho concludes.The findings will then be deliberated on by an independent panel of four judges who will select the winners.Rounding up the 2019 Building Trust Awards panel of judges are Sir David Tweedie who is the chairman of the board of trustees of the International Valuation Standards Council and past chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board; Tan Sri Dr Jemilah Mahmood who is under secretary general, partnerships at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; Malek Ali, who is the founder of BFM 89.9; and Nadiah Wan, the group CEO of TMC Life Sciences Bhd and CEO of the Thomson Hospital, Kota Damansara.The results will be revealed at an awards ceremony to be held in Kuala Lumpur, which is scheduled to take place in the second half of the year.This year, PwC also engaged the growing start-up community to understand their perspective on trust. However, start-up organisations are not part of the awards, which are currently meant for PLCs only.From the engagement, it is clear that large corporates can draw important lessons from start-ups on how to protect trust, which is vital to any start-up’s long-term survival, says Sri.“If they (start-ups) cannot get that (trust management) right, they believe that they are not going to be able to survive as a business. And I think that is probably a lesson for larger corporates where as you get bigger, you may have other priorities such as expansion or other engagement with stakeholders and shareholders as opposed to which segment actually makes your business work, which is the consumers who buy your products or services,” says Sri.“So we have seen the larger corporates refocusing on consumers and customers over the years. Their focus is on consumers and making sure that they get their consumers to believe in their idea and to address and to be very responsive to those consumers’ comments as well,” he adds.Interestingly, many start-ups feel that it is easier to boost trust as a big business, Sri reflects. On the other hand, start-ups also believe they can build up their trust reservoir through technology much faster, he adds.“They also believe that in the start-up phase, they can connect with the consumers quicker and in a more authentic manner than much more established businesses.“And, for established businesses, when you go into something that is new, it is more difficult to build trust because you are seen as this sort of business and doing this sort of thing, [but] trying to venture into something new.”In any case, the growing trust awareness in the business ecosystem in Malaysia is positive given that the private sector is a key driver of the economy, Sri says.“At the end of the day, it is about having businesses, corporates and start-ups, having the dialogue and discussion about the importance of trust. Businesses have a big role to play, and if we are able to raise the bar on how important trust is, then we are heading in the right direction.”To participate in the online poll, please visit http://bit.ly/pwctrustpoll 2019. CEOs weigh in on trust...As a leader, how do you inspire a culture of trust in Maybank?
Trust is ultimately about aligning personal and collective interests of a group to a pre-agreed destination — relying on each individual to do his part, so that the outcome is greater than the sum of the parts. The challenge is to ensure agreement among members that group interests should always take precedence over personal ones. It is ultimately a balancing act that needs to be monitored constantly.— Datuk Abdul Farid Alias,

Malayan Banking Bhd (winning company of the 2015 awards) How did Sime Darby Group sustain employee trust amidst the leadership changes following the demerger?
With the new leadership team in place, we set out to meet with groups of employees across our operations. These sessions were essentially open platforms for employees to air any concerns or questions they had, and for them to share their thoughts and ideas for the new organisation. They also provided us the opportunity to communicate our new vision, strategy and targets, and to project the new culture for Sime Darby Bhd.  — Datuk Jeffri Salim Davidson,
Group CEO,
Sime Darby Bhd (winning company of the 2017 awards) How can leaders articulate trust in a simple yet meaningful manner to their employees?  
For leaders to express trust to their employees, there must be commitment to a purpose that entails creating a better future for their people. Not only is it important for employees to know that their leader is committed to a worthy purpose; the leader must pursue that purpose based on the right set of values.  Deeply held values play a huge role in earning trust. Earning the trust of one’s employees is not just a soft, nice-to-have asset; it is the hard currency that makes a difference between success and failure.How can leaders build trust for their organisation’s long-lasting success?
Leaders build trust for their organisations through their actions – by setting direction that creates meaningful value for their stakeholders and enables empowered decision-making. In addition, leaders focus on designing the structures, deploying the right resources and supporting systems to execute the strategy. Underpinning all this, is the accountability for creating a culture of long-lasting excellence based on the right values and leading by example.—  Rajeev Peshawaria,

609,"March 14, 2019 13:30 pm +08",AIRASIA,"These should be final days for many flag carriers: Adam Minter","(March 14): On Tuesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told reporters he's studying whether to sell, shut down or refinance Malaysia Airlines Bhd, the troubled national carrier. A decision needs to be made soon. In 2018, the perpetually money-losing airline accounted for about half of the US$1.5 billion in losses suffered by its parent, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund.On purely economic terms, Mahathir’s decision should be easy. In 2014, following the loss of planes and lives in the MH370 disappearance and the tragic downing of MH17 over Ukraine, Khazanah announced a restructuring intended to make the airline profitable by 2018. It’s failed for one central reason: Malaysia Airlines remains a state-owned flag carrier, slow-moving and burdened by political expectations. At a time when low-cost airlines offer a perfectly adequate and more competitive alternative, Malaysia isn’t the only country that should rethink whether it really needs a national airline.The concept of a flag carrier dates back to the establishment in the mid-1940s of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations regulator. Every nation was given the opportunity to operate international air services. Some countries, including the U.S., chose to let private companies do the flying. Others decided to establish, subsidize and protect flag carriers, even to the point of restricting competition on key routes.Those airlines had goals other than profits. For decades, according to Brian Summers at Skift, ""nearly every national airline within 12 hours of New York flew to John F. Kennedy Airport, or wanted to — whether the flights lost money or not.""Why? For one thing, maintaining an international airline — and a New York route — was a statement of global purpose and ambition. Connections to major political and economic centres could attract attention, trade and investment. In some cases, they literally put one’s country on the map: Flying a successful airline with high standards of service was excellent marketing for several emerging economies (think Singapore). What’s more, national airlines proved to be ideal platforms for patronage, just as other state champions are.Malaysia Airlines, established in 1972 after it split from Singapore Airlines Ltd, embraced all of those goals. Helped along by the fast growth of Southeast Asia's economies, especially in the 1980s, it eventually maintained routes to dozens of international destinations including London, Los Angeles, Paris, Buenos Aires and Johannesburg.Not all were profitable and, by the mid-1990s, problems had started to accumulate. A poorly devised plan to privatize the airline saddled it with debt that became a crushing burden after the Asian Financial Crisis.What really undercut the flag carrier, though, was the emergence of privately held, ruthlessly efficient low-cost airlines such as AirAsia Group Bhd in the late 1990s. Just as in Europe, where Ryanair Holdings PLC and its low-cost counterparts had wreaked havoc on heavily subsidized national carriers from Air France-KLM to the now-defunct Malev Hungarian Airlines, the model upended Asia.Passengers, most of whom travel within the region when venturing abroad, eagerly took advantage of the lower prices, newer planes and oftentimes better customer service that the upstarts offered. Younger and hipper, the new airlines were oftentimes better advertisements for their host countries than their fusty rivals.By 2018, low-cost carriers had claimed around 28% of all airline seat capacity flown in Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, AirAsia had seized 55% of all passenger traffic by 2018. It could become Southeast Asia's largest airline this year, surging past giants such as Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways International PCL and Vietnam Airlines JSC.The impact on Malaysia Airlines has been devastating. Between 2001, the year the government resumed ownership, and 2014, the year of the MH370 and MH17 disasters, the government injected RM 17.4 billion into the struggling flag carrier to cover losses. The 2014 restructuring and privatization required an additional 6 billion ringgit.There will naturally be resistance to shutting down the carrier. ""Almost every country has its own national airline,"" declared Najib Razak, Malaysia's disgraced former prime minister on Tuesday. ""So we must have our national airline.”But, the truth is that unless governments are interested in turning back the clock on deregulation to protect flag carriers on the most profitable routes, the case for them becomes more sentimental than economically sensible. Worse, government support of national carriers such as Air India Ltd often encourages discounting and ruinous price wars. Even privatization isn’t much of an option; as long as an airline is viewed as a national asset, privately owned or not, any government will face pressure to support it.Some flag carriers such as Singapore Airlines successfully operate their own low-cost carriers. But, too many others continue to struggle with politically powerful unions and poor decision-making. Rather than burden taxpayers and the flying public further, it's time for their host nations to lower the flag.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/these-should-be-final-days-many-flag-carriers-adam-minter,"2019-05-01 20:09:17"
610,"March 14, 2019 12:21 pm +08",AIRASIA,"First Person: ‘Only use money you can afford to lose’","Jared Lee believes in the saying, “Don’t bite off more than you can chew”, when it comes to his career and managing his finances. He has adopted this philosophy based on his life experiences and the many challenges he faced when he was establishing his production house and YouTube channel called Grim Film in 2011.“You can invest in something when you have money that you do not mind losing. It is when you invest [the little money that you have], expect returns and it does not work out, that is when you suffer [financially],” says Lee.As someone who had a simple childhood, having been raised by a single mother who ran a hair salon, his definition of financial freedom is not having money problems on a daily basis and having some investments that generate returns. “It is when I do not have to worry about paying for food, have a place to live and am able to take care of my family. When it comes to personal investments, [financial freedom] is when I do not have to work and money grows without any effort,” he says.Coming from a creative background, financial instincts is not something that comes naturally to Lee. But that has not stopped him from learning by trial and error. “I wanted to deep dive into the creative aspect. But to survive in this industry, you have to service clients and manage expectations while making sure that you earn enough money to survive. It is finding a balance between the two, which I think a lot of creatives find very hard to do,” he says.Lee has worked with brands such as Uniqlo, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Samsung, Japan Tourism, Singapore Airlines, AirAsia and Grab. His company has won several international awards over the years while his YouTube video The Last 7 grabbed two awards at the Vancouver Web Fest in April last year. The short film had beaten the other nominees from Europe and North America to win the awards for Best Pilot and Best Special Effects. Lee’s videos have garnered more than 70,000 views on average. Setting up Grim FilmThe foundation for Grim Film was simple — passion. Lee realised his love of storytelling after completing a foundation course at an art college and subsequently, when he was studying mass communications at IACT College. It was during this time that he also discovered that he had a natural talent for filmmaking.“[In college] I had the opportunity to try a bit of everything that the creative industry had to offer. I was drawn to filmmaking during an in-class video assignment. There was a sense of joy while I was doing it,” says Lee.After graduating in 2011, he worked full-time at an event company while recording an album for his rock band and freelancing as a storyboard artist on the side. That was when he came up with the story idea for his short film, The Long Distance Relationship.“The story was one of those that came naturally and I wrote it without getting writer’s block. It was probably inspired by my own experiences of being in a long-distance relationship. But no one died in my story,” Lee laughs.He pitched the story to his friends and they loved it. They then decided to treat the exercise as a passion project and produce a zero-budget video. When it was completed, it was submitted to a short film competition in the US.“We uploaded the video on YouTube later that night just for feedback. We did not expect it to garner 70,000 views in the first week alone,” says Lee.“Soon, phone calls started coming in. There were job opportunities as well as opportunities to collaborate and make movies. I saw the opportunity to start something. So, I took a leap of faith and started Grim Film.”The Long Distance Relationship won the award for Best Drama at the American Film Festival in 2012. The video had attracted more than three million views as at March 6.To get things started, Lee spent RM15,000 on the necessary equipment for filming. This initial capital came from his savings. There were no overhead costs at the time because the company was just him and a friend and they would do their work in cafés.The first three years were the hardest for Lee. One of the challenges the then 26-year-old faced was a lack of experience in managing a company. “I did not know how to be a boss and run a production house. I had no experience dealing with clients. We had to learn from our mistakes and I burnt a lot of bridges during this time, which lost us a lot of potential jobs,” he says.The company often experienced inconsistent cash flow as many clients took their time to pay for completed jobs. In one case, Lee had to wait two years before he received payment.“You feel like you have money, but you do not. The industry has been operating this way for a long time. So, I learnt not to assume that I had the money until I saw it in my account,” he says.Things got so bad that there was even a time when Lee wished he would get into a minor car accident so that he could get, say, RM50 in compensation. This amount, he surmised, would allow him to get through the week.Then one day, his car was hit from behind and he received RM50 in compensation. But instead of repairing the car, he used the money for his daily sustenance. At this point, he knew that he had hit rock bottom financially.But Lee persevered. Despite his financial issues, the company continued to make videos and upload them on YouTube as a way of marketing its services. These videos generated interest in its services and the company managed to grow slowly.However, in the middle of 2012, business started to slow down because prospective clients were becoming sceptical about the services provided by Grim Film.“A bunch of us started out at the same time. We were among the pioneers on YouTube and there was a sudden boom in the industry. So, when it came to clients, there was a mindset that was hard to break because clearly, our set-up was minimal. But at the same time, we were delivering videos that generated viewing numbers that they had not seen before on the local scene. Things picked up slowly as people started to be educated on how we work and how they could use our services to benefit their brands,” says Lee. Other venturesIn addition to Grim Film, Lee tried his hand at other business ventures — a café in Subang called Morning Wood in 2015 and an event space in Sunway called Pintu Suka Hati in 2016.The café was a childhood dream of his as he had always wanted to run a food and beverage (F&B) business. The opportunity came about when the previous owners wanted to sell the café and a few of his friends were also interested in the business. So, they bought over the establishment — lock, stock and barrel — for RM300,000, of which Lee’s contribution was RM70,000.“We either made a profit or broke even every month. That was very good for a new café,” he says.However, none of the partners were there full-time as they had jobs of their own. Soon, the business stagnated.“I wish we had at least one partner with an F&B background so that we could give customers new items every month. It came to a point where I became very busy with production and I did not see the place for a whole month. So, we decided to sell the café at the end of 2017,” says Lee.As for Pintu Suka Hati, he invested in the business because he thought he would be able to rent out the space. However, things did not pan out quite the way he wanted them to.“The problem was that the place was pure white, even the floor. But people wanted event spaces that already had a design so that they did not have to spend on decorations,” says Lee.The business lasted a year before it was closed down, resulting in a RM70,000 loss for him.All three businesses were running simultaneously in 2016 and 2017. Lee had the confidence to invest in Morning Wood and Pintu Suka Hati because Grim Film’s business was picking up and he now had some extra income. “If I see a chance to do something, I will jump right in, even if I do not know what I am getting into. I use money that I can afford to lose,” he says.Choosing to look at the brighter side of things, the 34-year-old says his experiences have taught him what not to do if he gets into these sectors in the future. “If you ask me whether I am scared of the F&B business, I am not. If you ask me if I would open one again, the answer is yes. But this time, I know how I want to run it.”Lee had initially planned to invest in other companies, but Grim Film’s growth was something he could not ignore and funds were needed to support this growth. So, he put those plans on hold and invested in his own company.As for personal investments, Lee chose to buy a landed property in Subang three years ago, despite the real estate market being slow, as he believes in investing for the long term. “I do not expect to be rich the next year. What I mean is if you have money to buy, leave it there and for sure, you will make money in 10 years’ time,” he says.Lee used to invest in cryptocurrencies and the stock market, but lost some money doing so. He still has some money in his cryptocurrency wallet and is planning to keep it there. “Who knows, one day the price may go up,” he says.Lee married Malaysian actor and artist Marianne Tan in March 2016. But their financial journey as a couple started when they enrolled in a premarital counselling course.Lee admits that this has served as a guide for their marital life. “She earns her own money, so our method is more, ‘You do you and I will do me’. But when it comes to the daily necessities, she lets me handle that,” he says.With both of them being creatives and clueless about money and investments, Lee sometimes advises her on what she should do based on his experiences and mistakes. “We also made a deal that when it comes to any big expenditures, we will always consult each other first. When we are at peace with it, only then will we proceed,” he says.“I told her to put her money in fixed deposits first. Then, when the time is right and she feels ready, we will invest in property together.”Today, with the internet and information readily available at one’s fingertips, it is important to do your research online before venturing into anything, says Lee. “Everything is available to you as long as you have access to the internet. If not, you just need to ask people questions, whether they are strangers or friends. So, if you see them successful, just drop them a message on Facebook.”He says it is good that YouTube is paying attention to the industry in Malaysia, which will benefit the next generation as they will get more support and learn how to run a YouTube channel, avoiding all the mistakes he made through trial and error.“If I could turn back time, we would definitely be bigger than we are now in terms of the channel because now we know that consistency is the key — not just uploading frequently but also the theme of the content and analysing how people react to your content,” says Lee.“Data analytics emerged slightly too late for me and I wish I had learnt it earlier. But I hope the next generation will take it into account when they run their YouTube channel.”His mother’s journey ignited his passion for social causes, specifically tackling world hunger and education. Every year, he and his wife put aside money and donate it to Kingdomcity church as it has a team that builds schools and feeds the poor.“I grew up with my mother’s story, which I am hoping to turn into a movie someday because she went through hell, including taking up a job as a dishwasher at a restaurant so that she could eat the leftovers,” says Lee.“I know stopping world hunger would be an impossible dream, even if I were filthy rich. That is why education is important to me because they go hand in hand.”",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/first-person-only-use-money-you-can-afford-lose,"2019-05-01 20:09:18"

(March 13, RM7.74)
Maintain buy with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM9.44: The February 2019 passenger traffic for Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) airports (excluding Istanbul Sabiha Gocken Airport [ISGA]) grew by 5.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 8.1 million passengers. In fact, it was the first time that the eight million passenger traffic mark was breached in February. For ISGA, international passenger traffic grew by 19.5% y-o-y for the same month, the largest y-o-y growth in 13 months while domestic passengers declined by 2.7% y-o-y . This brings ISGA’s overall passenger growth in February to 4.4% y-o-y after hitting 2.5 million passengers. As such, MAHB’s total passenger traffic (including ISGA) grew by 5.1% y-o-y in February, marking its ninth consecutive month of y-o-y growth.Domestic traffic for Malaysia in February increased by 8.9% y-o-y to 3.9 million passengers, extending the y-o-y growth to its fourth straight month. This was in contrast to the 0.8% y-o-y drop in February 2018. The bulk of the growth was attributable to the 9.5% y-o-y jump in domestic traffic at airports ex-Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). We attribute the growth to the Chinese New Year (CNY) celebrations combined with the school holidays.International passenger traffic in Malaysia jumped by 2.3% y-o-y to reach 4.2 million passengers. It was also notable that the ratio of international to domestic passengers stood at 51:49 which bodes well for MAHB as the passenger service charge for international passengers is higher compared to domestic passengers. Likewise, the growth for international passengers can be linked to the CNY celebrations which coincided with a spike in the daily number of passengers of nearly 170,000 on Feb 10, 2018, the last day of the CNY holiday week.Economic crisis in Turkey: the country entered into a recession as its gross domestic product (GDP) contracted sharper than expected with seasonally adjusted 2.4% y-o-y drop in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2018 (4QCY18). Despite an assertion of downward pressure on the Turkish lira, we believe that a weaker lira could attract more international passengers into Turkey, especially via ISG. This will continue to uphold the robust growth in the ISG’s international sector which has been recording double-digit y-o-y growth in the past five months.While travelling sentiment may be affected in the short term due to the tragedy faced by Ethiopian Airlines, we opine that AirAsia Group Bhd (AAGB) (buy; TP:RM3.40) will continue to support the growth in KLIA with the latest contribution at 54%. AAGB also does not operate any Boeing MAX 8 aircraft and the same is applicable to Malindo Air and Cathay Pacific which are major contributors to KLIA’s main terminal passenger traffic.

612,"March 13, 2019 17:00 pm +08",AIRASIA,"‘We want to have a good relationship with all airlines’","GIVEN how closely Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) and AirAsia Group have to work together, one might think the two would be corporate best friends, at best.But the country’s biggest airport operator and its largest customer — which is also Asia’s biggest budget airline — have long had an openly frosty relationship.That certainly is not by design, says newly minted MAHB group CEO Raja Azmi Raja Nazuddin Azmi. “We want to have a good relationship with all airlines.”It is also worth noting that as Raja Azmi navigates MAHB through unprecedented structural upheavals in the airline industry, the on-off feud with AirAsia has also escalated to unprecedented heights under his watch.Last December, MAHB sued AirAsia Bhd and its long-haul affiliate AirAsia X Bhd for a combined RM36.1 million in uncollected passenger service charges (PSC) for international departures since July 1, 2018.In late January, AirAsia counter-sued MAHB, seeking RM400 million in damages and losses allegedly resulting from subpar airport services and facilities.For many long-time observers of the industry, the legal fight is the culmination of a long-running saga between the two as far as the PSC is concerned.AirAsia has long pushed for lowering the PSC whereas MAHB has argued that the PSC was low until the recent multiphase increase pushed through by the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom).And the tussle between two key players has raised eyebrows and alarmed investors, including the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), a substantial shareholder in both MAHB (10.56%) and AirAsia Group (5.64%).EPF has written to both parties imploring them to settle the matter amicably and met with AirAsia in early February. It is learnt that a meeting with MAHB is expected this week.Will MAHB consider an out-of-court settlement with AirAsia? Raja Azmi declines to comment. “Let the process take its course.”However, he stresses that the lawsuits does not affect the day-to-day working relationship between the two parties. MAHB, as the airport operator of 39 airports nationwide, remains fully supportive of AirAsia’s operations.“We know where the line is. It could have been any other airline (that MAHB has disagreements with),” says Raja Azmi. In no hurry to sell foreign operationsOn the international front, the big question mark for MAHB is whether the partial sale of its wholly-owned Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen International Airport (ISG) will still proceed. Last August, Turkish Airlines reportedly bid €750 million for an 80% stake in ISG, though no transaction materialised in the end.“The short answer is we are in no hurry to sell. Nothing will happen until the Turkish elections (in June 24) are over,” says Raja Azmi.Meantime, MAHB is still keen on disposing of its entire 11% stake in GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd. On Feb 2 last year, MAHB had agreed to sell the stake to GMR Airports Ltd for US$76.05 million (RM318.57 million), but the deal lapsed after GMR Airports failed to complete its obligations by Dec 31, 2018. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/we-want-have-good-relationship-all-airlines,"2019-05-01 20:09:19"

(March 12, RM2.74)
Maintain buy with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM3.40: There was a second tragedy recently involving the Boeing 737 MAX 8 in less than a year. On Sunday, an Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi crashed six minutes after take-off, killing 157 people on board. The plane — Boeing 737 MAX 8 — is the same model involved in a tragedy less than five months ago when a Lion Air flight crashed into the Karawang Waters in West Java.According to Boeing’s website, the Southeast Asian airlines using the Boeing 737 MAX 8 are Silk Air, Garuda Indonesia and Lion Air. Following the Ethiopian Airlines tragedy, Indonesia’s transportation ministry decided to ground all Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft in the country pending an airworthiness inspection. So far, Garuda Indonesia has taken additional inspections of its Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet with no faults found, but will continue conducting inspections of several systems suspected to be the main cause of the accident.Even if the overall inspections on Indonesian carriers using the Boeing 737 MAX 8 did not discover any faults, we opined that sentiments to fly on airlines with that particular aircraft could be affected in the short term. AirAsia Group Bhd’s current fleet of more than 100 aircraft does not include any aircraft from Boeing but instead uses Airbus aircraft. With this, we do not discount the possibility of a temporary shift in Indonesian passengers opting for AirAsia flights.We maintained our “buy” call with an unchanged TP of RM3.40 per share, pegging its financial year ending 2019 (FY19) earnings per share at price-earnings ratio (PER) of 10 times. Notably, AirAsia is trailing at a PER of 4.6 times, while its Asian peers are trading at an approximate PER above 10 times which we opined is unwarranted given the group being the leading Asean low-cost carrier.The possible shift of passengers to AirAsia due to the Boeing fleet absence could further sustain the group’s load factor to remain above 80%. We still like AirAsia as it continues to enhance its cost structure, along with its efforts in rationalising revenue and cost via digitalisation. We also believe a headwind from oil prices will be moderated by AirAsia’s hedging policies. Overall, we believe AirAsia’s prospects remain sanguine predicated on a stable demand growth with an average available seat kilometres expansion of 14% in FY18; and a resilient load factor despite volatile fuel prices. — MIDF Research, March 12",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/stable-demand-growth-expected-airasia,"2019-05-01 20:09:20"
615,"March 13, 2019 10:38 am +08",AIRASIA,"Still in the red as RM6b turnaround plan misses its mark","KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB) has bled for years as it struggled with costs and rising competition, despite multiple turnaround plans and changes at the helm.Dubbed one of the best airlines in the world in the late 2000s and up until recently, the national airline had just scooped up the Best Airline in Asia Award at this year’s International Council of Pacific Area Travel Writers Association International Travel Awards in Berlin.The latest blow came after its sole shareholder Khazanah Nasional Bhd was forced to impair RM7.3 billion in its books —about half of it due to the airline following its accumulated losses over the years. The impairment subsequently dragged the sovereign wealth fund into its first annual pre-tax loss in 13 years.Once one of Malaysia’s most lauded corporate brands, Malaysia Airlines leads the air transportation service business under its holding company Malaysia Aviation Group Bhd, with subsidiaries comprising low-cost carrier FlyFirefly Sdn Bhd; rural airline MASwings Sdn Bhd, and cargo airline MAB Kargo Sdn Bhd (MASkargo).In financial year 2017 (FY17) ended Dec 31, 2017, Malaysia Airlines recorded a loss after tax of RM812.11 million — nearly double from the RM438.87 million it incurred in FY16. This was despite revenue rising 1.12% year-on-year to RM8.67 billion from RM8.57 billion.As at end-FY17, its retained loss jumped to RM2.49 billion after three consecutive years of losses since it was delisted in 2014.Concurrently, its current liabilites stood at RM4.09 billion against current assets of RM3.94 billion and reserves of RM3.11 billion.Malaysia Airlines has yet to file its FY18 financial result, but management expects another loss-making year, albeit narrower than the year before.“We have seen good quarterly traction in the year and we are expecting to finish 2018 by reducing the losses of the previous year,” Malaysia Airlines group chief executive officer (CEO) Captain Izham Ismail said in a statement last December.“Moving forward, 2019 looks similarly challenging but we remain committed to improving performance and reducing costs whilst managing external factors beyond our control,” he said.FireFly, too, booked a net loss of RM36.65 million in FY17, on the back of a revenue of RM301.9 million. The low-cost carrier did not provide FY16 numbers.MASkargo, meanwhile, posted a net profit of RM46.49 million for FY17, compared to a net loss of RM27.23 million in the year before, despite revenue falling 18.08% to RM1.3 billion from RM1.1 billion in FY16.As for MASwings, it is understood that its operations are part of a government subsidy programme aimed at providing accessibility to rural areas, which may justify the fact that it continues to be loss-making and is still not commercially feasible.To recap, between 1997 and 2005, Malaysia Airlines — then Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS) — swung from profit to losses several times. In 2005, the government appointed Datuk Seri Idris Jala as its new CEO after the airline posted an annual loss of RM1.3 billion.A Business Turnaround Plan was launched in 2006, which helped bring the airline to profit up until 2010. However, rising costs and poor management again dragged the airline into the red from 2011 onwards.In 2011, a deal was mooted between Khazanah and Tan Sri Tony Fernandes’ Tune Air Sdn Bhd, where Khazanah would swap a 20% stake in then-listed MAS for a 10% stake in low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd in order to synergise the two Malaysian-born airlines and reduce competition against the national carrier.That deal was called off in 2012 amid pressure from MAS workers’ union due to fear of job cuts, according to reports.The latest 2014 turnaround effort was mooted following Malaysia Airlines’ dismal performance over the years and waning brand position after the double tragedy of the missing flight MH370 and flight MH17, which was shot down, that happened in March and July 2014, respectively.What followed was a RM1.4 billion takeover of Malaysia Airlines by Khazanah to take the company private as part of its 12-point MAS Recovery Plan.A group-wide restructuring was conducted, and MAS was renamed Malaysia Airlines Bhd and became a wholly-owned entity of Khazanah. Among the steps taken was to cut 6,000 out of nearly 20,000 jobs, and to provide a RM6 billion provision to the company — the bulk of which was drawn down — for a five-year plan to change its loss-making fate.Pundits at the time viewed the measures undertaken as similar to that of Japan Airlines (JAL), which managed to turn around in just three years after filing for bankruptcy following a decade of losses. JAL, too, underwent a government-backed restructuring where it shed a third of its workforce, cut unprofitable routes and received support from a quasi-government entity, which provided ¥300 billion in fresh capital.Khazanah’s intention was to make Malaysia Airlines sustainably profitable by end-2017, and to subsequently relist the company by end-2019 — two deadlines that have been moved forward, and which now seem unlikely.Amid all these, Malaysia Airlines has moved to renew and expand its fleet. It has been reported that the company currently has outstanding orders for 15 units of Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 10 units of MAX 10 to be delivered progressively from 2020.The government has requested Khazanah to review the aircraft purchase agreement with Boeing Co, in light of two tragic crashes of MAX 8 jet in October 2018 and March 11 this year.It is unclear at this juncture what is option the most likely for Putrajaya as it considers how to resolve the conundrum at Malaysia’s national carrier. But considering the financial constraints faced by the government — which had announced it was facing a public debt of RM1 trillion — they will have to decide on a course of action soon.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/still-red-rm6b-turnaround-plan-misses-its-mark,"2019-05-01 20:09:20"

Naturally, the first use case was looking at how we can tokenise our loyalty points,” she said during a panel session at the Digital Innovation Conference organised by the British Malaysian Chamber of Commerce here yesterday.By tokenising its loyalty points, the group hopes the points can be used in various marketplaces. Aireen said the airline aims for its loyalty points to be somewhat of a digital currency for Asean, given the group’s strong presence in the region.“We are looking at cryptocurrency but one backed by economic purpose and a real regional use case, as opposed to just speculation like what we have seen in previous ICOs,” she added.Secondly, she said AirAsia is looking at building a collaborative platform or a marketplace for the aerospace industry, relating to the maintenance of aircraft parts.By using blockchain, the group could be more efficient operationally as it allows the tracing of aircraft parts in use, as well as their status and well-being. This would help in ensuring on-time performance and reducing on-ground time, she said.“This is a very interesting use case that actually covers not just the airlines, but also the original equipment manufacturers and many other important stakeholders across the value chain.”This also works in favour of aviation regulators such as the Department of Civil Aviation and the Malaysian Aviation Commission, she said, as it would be easier for them to trace the records of aircraft and their components.AirAsia is also looking to use blockchain to increase efficiency of the cargo business, where there are many cases of fraud, Aireen said, given the number of middlemen taking advantage of pricing differences.She said the technology can be used to open up the process and increase transparency in real-time pricing and better traceability of goods.“There will be some operational challenges concerning new technology. We are still trying to understand how best to proceed. There are some areas where the regulatory requirements are not very clear.”Meanwhile, she said AirAsia aims to be more than just an airline, targeting to get more involved in e-commerce, leveraging on the data it has accumulated on its passengers’ behaviours.“We have about 100 million passengers a year and we know the trends of our passengers — their interests and so on. So, why just stick to flying? We can use the data to make their journeys more pleasant and seamless, from when they book their flights to arriving at their destinations.”During the panel discussion, NEM Malaysia Sdn Bhd investments and strategy director Jasmine Ng said while investments to explore blockchain’s implementation in businesses could be costly, she said there is a huge potential upside.NEM Malaysia offers consultation on implementing blockchain in public and private institutions, small and medium enterprises, and also among individuals.“Given blockchain is an entirely new operating system, there will definitely be costs when businesses want to plug in. However, there is a potential of opening up new revenue streams that businesses can take advantage of, ahead of their competitors.“The technology is not fully mature yet but even in its nascent state, we can already see its potential. As people get creative in applying the technology, new industries and economic pillars will be created,” she said. The Edge is the media partner for the British Malaysian Chamber of Commerce’s Digital Innovation Conference.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/airasia-studying-three-blockchain-use-cases-%E2%80%94-deputy-ceo,"2019-05-01 20:09:21"

However, it will take delivery of 25 of Boeing 737 MAXs starting next year.“Malaysia Airlines does not currently have any Boeing 737 MAXs on its fleet.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by the tragedy,” it said.To recap, the national carrier had ordered 25 737 MAXs in 2016. The following year, Boeing and Malaysia Airlines announced that 10 of the 737 MAXs on order will be converted to 737 MAX 10s.On top of that, Boeing managed to secure another order from Malaysia Airlines during former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s official visit to Washington in 2017.During the official visit, Najib witnessed the signing of memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Malaysia Airlines and Boeing for the national carrier to buy eight 787-9 Dreamliners worth US$2.2 billion at list prices.The MoU includes Boeing’s Global Fleet Care service to maintain the national carrier’s current and future Boeing aircraft.Aircraft 737 MAXs is the most popular airplane manufactured by Boeing. It is under scrutiny after a deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday, leading several countries and airlines around the world to ground their fleets’ 737 MAX 8 planes.Separately, Transport Minister Anthony Loke told Parliament yesterday that the government has no immediate decision on cancelling the orders as yet.The Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia has yet to issue any statement on its stance.It is understood that compensation will be involved for any cancellation of order of aircraft. However, in such circumstance, it is not sure how Boeing strategise its move should there be cancellation on safety concern.On Sunday, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed shortly after take-off, killing all 157 passengers on board.It was the second 737 MAX 8 to crash in under six months. The first occurred in October last year, when the plane, operated by Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air, crashed 13 minutes after take-off and killed all 189 on board.In a separate statement, Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd said it does not have any 737 MAX in operations currently.“(We) will be more diligent in any future plan of aircraft delivery from the MAX family,” its chief executive office (CEO) Chandran Rama Muthy said, expressing his condolence on the tragic Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday.Malindo Air operates a fleet of 42 aircraft which consist of 29 737 NGs and 13 ATR72-600s.When contacted, a spokesperson from Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd declined to comment on whether it will stop the 737 MAX aircraft type from operating at its airports, noting that it is not the authority in terms of air safety as far as the aircraft are concerned.“Airlines are subject to stringent air safety procedures and guidelines by International Civil Aviation Organisation and respective civil aviation authorities,” the spokesperson told The Edge Financial Daily yesterday.Meanwhile, AirAsia Group Bhd group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes on his Twitter account expressed his condolences to those affected by the tragedy.Following the crash in Ethiopia, Ethiopian Airlines has grounded its Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet until further notice.

Competition has helped make flights cheaper and improved the pay of cabin crew.Market conditions also worsened during the four years as Malaysia Airlines grappled with high jet fuel prices and a smaller network and fleet. Carriers like Singapore Airlines Ltd and AirAsia, known for their efficient management, are facing similar challenges. As for Malindo, it has yet to turn in a profit since it was launched in 2013.It does not help that Malaysia Airlines’ financials are not publicly available despite being funded by the government.However, shutting down the airline would mean less competition, hurting consumers.

Only 224 companies recorded EPS growth with 113 turning profitable and 54 narrowing their losses.According to Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau, 4Q earnings were largely in line with expectations, as seen by some of the earnings downgrades towards the end of last year.“If you look at the market, most analysts cut their earnings projections last year. This was reflected by the decline in the stock market. As we have seen, the lacklustre third-quarter earnings have continued into the fourth quarter, albeit with a bit of improvement,” Lau says.Indeed, 4Q earnings were slightly better than 3Q’s, with 249 companies recording EPS growth versus 228 that contracted.Bloomberg data shows that the construction sector was among those affected as 27 players saw a decline in earnings versus 11 that recorded growth.Apart from construction, property, food packaging and plantations were among the top losers. The logistics sector also saw an increase in underperformers as competition in the space intensified.The banking sector had a relatively good 2018, but results were mixed in the last quarter, a notable decline was seen in Public Bank Bhd’s EPS on a year-on-year basis.The automotive and oil and gas sectors look fairly interesting as there are selective opportunities for investors, given that some companies turned around in 4Q.MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman says the results have generally met expectations — banks, healthcare and construction companies under its coverage look good.Other sectors turned in mixed results, a notable loser being plantations, owing to lower crude palm oil (CPO) prices in 4Q2018.“Looking at the winners, we reckon it is better to look at company specifics. For example, those related to commodity prices. While the price of oil was high for the first half of 4Q (until around mid-November), most oil and gas counters saw weak earnings. Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd did well, aided by a higher plant utilisation rate and selling prices, while Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd’s increased work orders for its maintenance services resulted in strong top and bottom-line growth,” Redza says.Even though the environment in the O&G space remains challenging, 11 companies managed to turn profitable during the quarter, including Dayang Enterprise and Velesto Energy Bhd.Redza observes that although the higher oil price did not create a clear winner in the O&G industry, it did impact the aviation sector. AirAsia Group Bhd and AirAsia X Bhd flew into the red during 4Q, while Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd’s (MAHB) earnings (excluding one-off gains) were also below expectations.He adds that other winners include IHH Healthcare Bhd and UEM Edgenta Bhd.Another winner was the insurance industry. Tune Protect Group Bhd and Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd did well, driven by the travel reinsurance segment and higher net earned contributions respectively.“There was good earnings recovery for some of the telcos but Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd saw a drastic deterioration in earnings,” Redza says.Moving forward, he believes there will be some upside, especially on the commodity front, as higher CPO prices and recovering palm oil exports will boost plantation companies.“Construction players will also see better outcomes as uncertainties over project awards become a thing of the past, and we have seen a slew of contracts won by companies such as Sunway Construction Group Bhd, Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, KKB Engineering Bhd and Hock Seng Lee Bhd, which have been announced in recent months.“It looks like our bullish view on infrastructure development in Sarawak has come to fruition,” Redza says, adding that upward revisions to earnings expectations are on the cards. However, they are unlikely to be across the board amid uncertainties over geopolitical issues.Lau agrees with Redza. He says that even some companies that were perceived to be linked to the previous government managed to record strong earnings.MyEG Services Bhd was one such, posting strong quarterly earnings of RM58.1 million, or 1.7 sen per share, translating into a net margin of about 50%.Most companies warn that the outlook for 2019 remains cautious amid uncertainties over geopolitical tensions in the form of the US-China trade war, Brexit and regional elections.“The key risks remain those on the external front, such as the US-China trade negotiations,” Lau opines.But another fund manager with a local asset management firm believes that local political developments will play an even more critical role as corporates are looking at Pakatan Harapan’s policies and direction before making any investment decisions.“Most of the guidance for 2019 has been for cautious optimism. It is because many are waiting to see if there is any impact from some of the changes made by the new government.“We are also seeing that the government is talking about potentially continuing with some of the infrastructure projects that are under heavy scrutiny, such as the ECRL (East Coast Rail Link) project,” he says. The FBM KLCI’s EPS fell 10% y-o-y in 2018The FBM KLCI component stocks saw 2018 EPS fall by about a tenth compared with a year ago, with Axiata and Genting Malaysia Bhd being the top losers. Both companies slipped into a net loss. The gaming counter slid into its first annual loss since 2000, of 3.5 sen per share, while the telco saw its first full-year loss of 55.6 sen per share since listing in 2008.Twelve of the 30 component stocks also posted weaker performances last year compared with 2017. They include plantation players Sime Darby Plantations Bhd and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK).Petronas Dagangan Bhd’s EPS also dropped about 45% to 85.5 sen last year, from FY2017.MAHB, on the other hand, was the top performer last year with a tripling of its EPS, mainly due to an unrealised gain on the fair value of its investment in GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd.The airport operator was followed by IOI Corp Bhd and Top Glove Bhd.The banking sector was also one of last year’s bright spots, based on the growth recorded by CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, AMMB Holdings Bhd and Malayan Banking Bhd.An analyst at a local investment bank believes investors had priced in weaker 4Q earnings. Their instinct proved spot-on as the equity benchmark index shrank 5.9% last year. Year to date, it has gained 1% to close at 1,707.73 points last Thursday.While it is still early days, investors could be gearing up to put last year’s underperformance behind them in the belief that a gradual recovery could be in place. There are some signs pointing in that direction. The Bursa Malaysia Construction Index plunged 50% last year, but is one of the top performers year to date, with a gain of 15.7%.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-4q-earnings-weaker-year-year-improvement-over-3q,"2019-05-01 20:09:25"

It is too early to make any comments as the cause of the incident has yet to be ascertained,” the national carrier said it a statement.“We have, however, written to Boeing seeking for more technical details ahead of the delivery of our order expected in 2020. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by the tragedy,” it added.In 2016, the national carrier had ordered 25 737 MAXs. In June 2017, Boeing and Malaysia Airlines had announced a decision to convert 10 of the national airline's current 737 MAXs on order to 737 MAX 10s.Separately, Transport Minister Anthony Loke told Parliament today that the government has no immediate decision on whether the orders will be cancelled. “There is no immediate decision right now but I’m not saying we are continuing the deal or cancelling it, just no decisions right now,” Loke said.In a separate statement, Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd said it does not have any 737 MAX in operations currently.""(We) will be more diligent in any future plan of aircraft delivery from the MAX family,"" its chief executive office (CEO) Chandran Rama Muthy said, expressing his condolence on the tragic Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday (March 10). ""Our thoughts and prayers go to those who are affected in the tragedy.""Malindo Air operates a fleet of 42 aircraft which consist of 29 737 NGs and 13 ATR72-600s.On Sunday, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed shortly after take-off, killing all 157 passengers on board.It was the second 737 MAX 8 to crash in under six months. The first occurred in October last year, when the plane, operated by  Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air, crashed 13 minutes after take-off and killed all 189 on board.In a statement dated March 10 on its official website, Boeing said it is “deeply saddened” for the latest tragedy in Ethiopia. ""A Boeing technical team will be travelling to the crash site to provide technical assistance under the direction of the Ethiopia Accident Investigation Bureau and US National Transportation Safety Board,"" it added.When contacted, a spokesperson from Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) declined to comment on whether it will stop the 737 MAX aircraft type from operating at its airports, noting that it is not the authority in terms of air safety as far as the aircraft are concerned.“Airlines are subject to stringent air safety procedures and guidelines by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and respective civil aviation authorities,” the spokesperson told theedgemarkets.com today. Meanwhile, AirAsia Group Bhd group chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes on his Twitter account expressed his condolences to those affected by the tragedy. “My condolences to all on board [the flight]. And to all who have lost friends [and] colleagues,” he said.“I fly @flyethiopian regularly,” he said in his tweet, referring to Ethiopian Airlines’ official Twitter handle. “Great airline,” he added.Following the crash in Ethiopia, Ethiopian Airlines has grounded its Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet until further notice. China’s aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) also reportedly grounded its 96 units of the aircraft type operated by its airlines. Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) has yet to issue any statement on its stance.

625,"March 07, 2019 16:28 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Fernandes reassures on best ever year ahead, what do analysts think of AirAsia's prospects?","KUALA LUMPUR (March 7): After he tweeted that AirAsia Group Bhd has made all the right moves in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18), co-founder Tan Sri Tony Fernandes then tweeted another message saying he stood by his remark that 2019 will be the best-ever year for the low-cost carrier.In the tweet, Fernandes, who along with his partner Datuk Kamarudin Meranun are the largest controlling shareholders of the group, told the investing public that shareholders who have faith in the airline will be rewarded with earnings growth and dividends.""Look out for results in the first quarter (ending March 31, 2019),"" he tweeted last Friday (March 1).The duo's investment vehicles — Tune Live Sdn Bhd and Tune Air Sdn Bhd — own 32.5% stake in AirAsia.In fact, AirAsia shareholders were already rewarded with bumper dividend of 64 sen per share (including a special dividend of 40 sen) in FY18.This translates into a payout ratio of 108%.The record high dividend, however, did not seem to lend much support to the carrier's share price, which has been on the decline since a year ago. Probably more attention has been drawn to its largest ever quarterly net loss.AirAsia last week announced that due to higher fuel costs and operating lease expenses, it posted a net loss of RM394.97 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (4QFY18), compared to a net profit of RM372.6 million a year ago, although its quarterly revenue had grown 6.2% to RM2.82 billion.Bloomberg data shows a quarter of the 20 research houses that cover AirAsia have downgraded their ratings the day after the quarterly results announcement, leaving the airline with eight ""buy"" calls, and six each for ""hold"" and ""sell"" calls.Some RM6.21 billion in market capitalisation has evaporated since March 1 last year, when its price was at an all-time high of RM3.85 apiece, valuing AirAsia at RM15.37 billion. Last Friday, it ended at RM2.74, giving it a market capitalisation of RM9.16 billion.AirAsia, despite the large quarterly losses, was profitable for FY18 with an annual profit of RM1.97 billion or 59.2 sen per share, compared with RM1.62 billion or 49.3 sen per share in FY17.Excluding a laundry list of one-off items, for example foreign exchange gain of RM130.8 million, fair value loss on derivatives of RM200.2 million, one-off expenses relating to BBAM Ltd Partnership of RM146 million, and provision for doubtful third-party charter debts of RM60 million, AirAsia recorded a FY18 core net profit of RM838.6 million, according to Public Invest Research, which has an ""outperform"" call on the airline.The research outfit pegs its target price (TP) at RM3.70, which is 35% above last Friday's closing of RM2.74.To recap, in March last year, AirAsia announced a US$1.185 billion sales and leaseback deal to divest wholly-owned aircraft leasing unit Asia Aviation Capital Ltd (AACL) to BBAM.Fernandes also commented in the tweet massage that the divestment of AACL was ""fantastic"", as it locked in the aircraft's residual value and beefed up AirAsia's balance sheet, while enabling it to pay out generous dividend.Nomura analyst Ahmad Maghfur Usman is upbeat on AirAsia's earnings outlook ""on the back of lower fuel costs coupled with the turnaround from its Asean affiliates, while losses from India are expected to narrow on improved scalability as passenger volumes increase"".Maghfur's TP of RM5.20 is the highest among analysts polled by Bloomberg.He noticed that AirAsia has been more disciplined in terms of capacity management for Malaysia and Indonesia to drive up yield and boost load factor.Higher yield and load factor are what all airlines are looking for simply because these will help widen profit margin.However, CIMB Research analyst Raymond Yap holds a contrasting view on Asia's biggest low-cost carrier, whose share price has declined nearly 29% from the peak.In the financial result review dated Feb 28, Yap wrote that AirAsia is likely to incur higher provisions for aircraft maintenance charges compared to the time before the sale and leaseback model take place.""All else being equal, the squeeze on AirAsia's profitability will continue to get tighter since a substantial number of AirAsia's order book with Airbus has been committed for subsequent sale and leaseback with BBAM.""With lower profitability, AirAsia will be less resilient to the unexpected changes in the business environment,"" Yap commented, adding that competition may intensify as Malaysia Airlines Bhd and Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd are expected to increase capacity.Yap, who has a ""reduce"" call and a TP of RM1.82 on AirAsia, also cautioned that the new airport departure levy and the potential passenger service charge increase are expected to hurt travel demand in Malaysia, which might result in AirAsia subsidising these rate increases.When contacted, Maybank Investment Bank aviation analyst Mohshin Aziz told The Edge Financial Daily that as competition intensify, AirAsia's pricing power would be substantially lower.""Beyond that, a lot of their costs have increased. The aircraft operating lease cost, in particular, was quite painful to the company, it had increased more than what we have led to believe,"" he said.Although Mohshin said AirAsia's management has said that the worst may have been over and the Malaysian airline industry is seeing a slow recovery, his own observation seems to suggest that airfares are still in a cheap environment.Mohshin has a ""sell"" call on AirAsia, with a fair value of RM2.28. He does not rule out that selling pressure may persist for a while longer.Analysts have various views on the prospects of AirAsia.Some are paying attention to dark clouds on the horizon, while others see a silver lining behind the dark clouds.All said, Fernandes reiterated that ""time will tell"" if AirAsia is on the right path to greater height.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fernandes-reassures-best-ever-year-ahead-what-do-analysts-think-airasias-prospects,"2019-05-01 20:09:27"

628,"March 06, 2019 15:00 pm +08",AIRASIA,"AirAsia X braces for another tough year ","AFTER a year to forget in 2018, long-haul budget carrier AirAsia X is heading into what could be another difficult year. But how it performs in 2019 depends on whether its efforts to mitigate last year’s headwinds bear fruit.Its fourth-quarter financial report, released last Thursday, capped the ending to a difficult year defined by rising jet fuel costs and stiff competition, though a slightly strengthening ringgit softened the impact.For the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (4QFY2018), AirAsia X posted an operating profit of RM33.9 million, its first in three consecutive quarters. In 3QFY2018, it registered an operating loss of RM202.5 million, the highest since it listed in July 2013.But the operating profit was not enough as heavy loan repayment commitments dragged the airline into the red. In 4QFY2018 alone, it posted RM187.34 million in repayments, not including interest.That means the airline continued burning through its dwindling cash reserves, which had shrunk further to RM252.6 million as at Dec 31, 2018 — its lowest in nearly three years.Overall, it was AirAsia X’s third consecutive loss-making quarter and the fourth in the last six financial quarters running.For FY2018, its net loss came to RM312.7 million, the second loss-making year in four consecutive years. Revenue slipped marginally by 0.4% year on year to RM4.54 billion.The numbers contrast with the recent optimism by AirAsia group co-founder Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, who last month declared that 2019 will be AirAsia X’s “best year ever”.That declaration sparked a brief share price rally, with AirAsia X surging 30% over four trading days between Jan 2 and 7 to 30.5 sen.Last Thursday, the stock ended at 29 sen, having lost 28.4% of its value over the last 12 months. Its market capitalisation was about RM1.2 billion.“We have worked hard to get the right model and the right routes for AirAsia X. We are confident it can be as profitable as AirAsia [group eventually],” Fernandes, a substantial shareholder who does not hold any executive role in AirAsia X, told The Edge recently.That said, analysts The Edge spoke to are not as optimistic, though some agree it would be a better year for the budget long-haul airline.To be sure, the intensely competitive landscape looks poised to remain this year, according to an early February report by the CAPA — Centre for Aviation.AirAsia X currently serves 29 destinations across Asia and is also the first Asean-based low-cost airline to get the green light to operate into the US.Its fleet comprises 36 planes, including four newly delivered aircraft in end-2018 on lease.With its diverse destinations, foreign exchange volatility also remains a double-edged sword for AirAsia X, whose borrowings are mainly in US dollars but not revenue.In a report, CAPA noted that a number of airlines are on an aggressive expansion path despite overcapacity in a price-sensitive environment.This could continue the aggressive price war seen in the first nine months of last year despite a jet fuel price increase, it added.“The decline in fuel prices in 4Q2018 provided some relief but the aggressive competition in Southeast Asia is continuing, leading to some extraordinarily low fares for both short-haul and long-haul travel.“Market conditions in Southeast Asia are challenging. A low cost base is king,” the aviation research outfit concluded.AirAsia X was not spared the same headwinds last year and it is no surprise that it is reconfiguring its cost base to be more competitive this year.Its first initiative was to stabilise the fuel cost. In a brief email reply, the airline confirms that it has hedged 52% of its fuel requirements for 2019 at US$63 per barrel.In comparison, it only hedged about 15% of its fuel needs at an average of US$78.30 per barrel in 4QFY2018. “While Singapore jet kerosene price was at US$94.10 per barrel at the beginning of 4QFY2018, it slid as much as 28.7% to reach US$67.10 per barrel, enabling AirAsia X to leverage the spot market,” said MIDF Research last month.The significantly higher hedging would reduce much volatility in the fuel cost for AirAsia X, with upside from any fuel price downward trend this year.In addition, AirAsia X has also been optimising its routes to focus on profitable ones this year, analysts The Edge spoke to say.How successful the fuel hedging and route optimisation will turn out to be remains to be seen.Historically, major swings in fuel prices had wreaked havoc on AirAsia X’s bottom line, especially in the second and third quarters, traditionally its weakest.For perspective, falling jet fuel prices in the fourth quarter dragged its cost per available seat kilometre (CASK) down to 12.27 sen, the lowest in four quarters. It is worth noting that 3QFY2018 CASK was at a multi-year high due to surging fuel prices.In comparison, its revenue per available seat kilometre (RASK) had also been under competitive pressure in recent years as reflected in the falling average passenger fare on a quarterly basis.While RASK exceeded CASK in 4QFY2018, that was only the third time in seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, its 4QFY2018 average passenger fare was RM490, the lowest fourth-quarter figure in at least three years.Should fuel prices and foreign exchange volatility remain in its favour this year, AirAsia X still has to contend with its high borrowing cost. Its dwindling cash reserves have prompted questions on whether a cash call is looming.To put its debt strain into perspective, its total borrowings come to RM687.05 million, of which RM192.32 million are short-term. In comparison, its available cash reserves as at Dec 31, 2018, totalled RM252.6 million.Its saving grace could be its assets held for sale, listed as its current assets, worth RM999.01 million. The Edge understands that this represents the five aircraft AirAsia X is looking to sell in a sale-leaseback arrangement.Sources say negotiations are underway and a transaction is expected to be concluded by the middle of the year at the latest.In a Feb 12 note, Nomura Research said cash from the potential aircraft disposal would be used to pare down debt.“Management is [also] negotiating for lower leases on some of its existing aircraft in exchange for attractive selling prices on its aircraft disposals to the lessor [and to be leased back by AirAsia X],” the research house said.The outcome of the aircraft disposal will be closely watched by shareholders and investors, who would be keen to avoid a cash call.If the debt strain is resolved, then AirAsia X will see clearer skies ahead as long as it keeps its costs low and pushes fares higher. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/airasia-x-braces-another-tough-year,"2019-05-01 20:09:29"

We have a mature and good working relationship with the MoT, the minister, [while] the secretary-general is our commissioner.“So, if they have anything like that [to disband Mavcom], they would discuss with Mavcom,” he said after attending Khazanah Research Institute’s panel discussion on “Malaysian Input-Output Analysis and Industrial Policy” here yesterday.Therefore, Nungsari, who is also the institute’s chairman, said the speculation has had no impact on the morale of Mavcom’s staff, and that the commission’s operation remains as usual.“Because somebody went and threw something [rumour] out, people got excited ... That is why we have not issued any statement on this.

632,"March 06, 2019 08:31 am +08",AIRASIA,"Khazanah posts first pre-tax loss since 2005","KUALA LUMPUR: Khazanah Nasional Bhd posted its first pre-tax loss in 13 years in 2018, amid significant impairment provisions made during the year — a big chunk of which was due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB) — but hopes to return to profitability in 2019.The sovereign wealth fund reported a pre-tax loss of RM6.3 billion for 2018, compared to its pre-tax profit of RM2.9 billion in the preceding year, after recording impairments totalling RM7.3 billion — more than triple the RM2.3 billion seen in 2017.The last time it fell into the red was in 2005, when the fund reported a pre-tax loss of RM831 million.Khazanah managing director (MD) Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said the sizeable impairment reflected the drop in market value of the share prices of listed stocks the fund holds, as well as the decline in the fair carrying value of some of its unlisted assets.“Our performance in 2018 was impacted by several key global and domestic developments in both the economic and social spheres. At the same time, the government initiated a reset of Khazanah, which involved significant changes including a refreshed mandate,” he said at the Khazanah annual review yesterday.The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends from its investments in 2018, down 9.7% from the RM3.1 billion it recorded in the previous year, while divestment gains halved to RM1.4 billion for the year from RM2.8 billion, reflecting the challenging market conditions during the year.“Looking ahead into 2019, Khazanah should be able to return to profit, given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books. We don’t expect any more large impairments that we have to go through again in 2018.“The provisions are primarily due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which accounted for roughly half of the total impairments for 2018,” he said.Its portfolio’s realisable asset value (RAV) — or the market value of all equities, securities and cash held — fell to RM136 billion in 2018 from RM157 billion a year ago. In terms of net worth adjusted — which is RAV less total liabilities and adjusted to measure value created — that fell 21.6% to RM91 billion from RM116 billion, weighed by subdued earnings outlook, market volatility and regulatory changes. Challenging conditions in the airline industryShahril said the airline industry is challenging, as he pointed to persistent overcapacity and how airlines in the country, such as the region’s leading low-cost airline AirAsia Bhd, are also struggling.While Malaysia Airlines was a drag on Khazanah’s financials for 2018, he justified the fund’s investment in the airline by saying that it provides other economic benefits to the country beyond the fund’s bottom line. As an example, he cited the connectivity it provides that brings business and leisure travellers into Malaysia, which indirectly contributes to the economy.However, he said that does not discount the fact that the national airline should be as operationally efficient as possible.“Quite clearly, the strategy put in place for Malaysia Airlines has not met its objectives. That is a fact we have to acknowledge. The question now is whether it makes sense to continue with the same strategy or do we need to rethink how the airline operates given the challenging environment?“We are waiting for Malaysia Airlines to complete its review and we will be looking at understanding what that startegy requires,” he said. Drop in TM’s market valueAnother factor that drove Khazanah into the red was Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), which saw a substantial fall in market value following the 83% drop in the group’s net profit for 2018, which Shahril attributed to regulatory changes.TM registered a 56.9% decline in total returns, the biggest decliner in Khazanah’s portfolio, followed by Axiata Group Bhd (-26.9%), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-9.3%), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-7.9%), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-7.6%) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-3.3%).Shahril said the market has priced in the fact that TM will take some time to improve its cost base, following the government’s move to bring down consumer pricing as quickly as possible.As the telecommunications company shifts its pricing to reflect the new regulatory environment, revenue will be affected, he said, but added that profitability will return given time. Portfolio rebalancing to spread risk concentrationMeanwhile, Shahril said the fund will remain focused on executing its portfolio rebalancing strategy and strengthening its financial position.He stressed that Khazanah is looking at long-term returns and that it is natural for there to be fluctuations in the market over long periods of time, especially since the fund’s portfolio is very much equity-based. “The key thing to focus on is the fact that we are restructuring the portfolio and are geared towards long-term returns,” Shahril said.The portfolio rebalancing, he said, will look at taking out some of the inherent risks in its portfolio, such as the concentration of risk it is facing given that a big chunk of its investments in Malaysia are tied up in just a few companies. So, over time, Khazanah will have a more balanced portfolio spread over more sectors and geographies to mitigate the concentration of risk, and benefit from a more diversified portfolio.Khazanah is also splitting its portfolio into two — commercial and strategic. The commercial portion targets returns equivalent to inflation plus 3% on a five-year rolling basis. It will comprise public assets such as CIMB, Axiata, IHH and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Company Sdn Bhd, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.The strategic portion is a developmental fund targeting returns equivalent to the 10-year Malaysian Government Securities yield on a five-year rolling basis. It includes strategic assets such as TM, TNB, MAB and PLUS Malaysia Bhd and developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia.Meanwhile, as part of the review of the fund’s operational costs, Khazanah is looking at the operations of its international offices and may take steps to improve their operations.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example. We have a lot of investments in the country and a lot of these are private equity investments, so we need people on the ground to ensure those assets are managed well and are creating value for Khazanah as a whole.“Some of the other offices, for instance in London, may be less important because we will be adopting a more market-driven approach. So, we can do more of the operations out of other offices. As we review our costs and business operations, if there is a cost benefit to us by running the international offices in a different way, we will make those decisions as we go along,” he said. Not in talks with any party for Legoland saleMeanwhile, when asked if Khazanah had received offers for Legoland Malaysia Resort — following a news report that the fund is looking to sell the theme park — Shahril said Khazanah is not in talks with any party, though the the fund is reviewing all its assets.“Legoland is not only Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) positive — it’s returning a positive profit as well. The time will come when we need to think about reinvesting the capital.“Everything has a value at the end of the day and if a great valuation comes in, we will look and see whether the capital that can be returned to our books can be better deployed in other areas,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/khazanah-posts-first-pretax-loss-2005,"2019-05-01 20:09:32"

637,"March 05, 2019 15:00 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Special Report: ‘Break up airports for good reason, not for politics’","CALLS to open up the airport sector to new operators and allow more airports to be built, via a public-private partnership (PPP) model, have been growing since Pakatan Harapan came to power.Recent events have shown the government’s willingness to reconsider such privatisation and liberalisation policies as the panacea for the country’s economic woes, as well as to fulfil PH’s 14th general election pledge to do away with monopolies.Transport Minister Anthony Loke said last November that the federal government was negotiating a new operating agreement (OA) with Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB), the country’s only public-listed airport operator, to break up the 39 airports the latter manages into five regional clusters, in order to allow new private airport operators to run them.Currently, MAHB has two OAs — one to operate the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Sepang (including klia2) and another to operate the remaining 38 airports in the country.Several state governments have announced ambitious plans to build greenfield airports, regardless of demand from actual passengers who may want to use those facilities. On Feb 13, Kedah Menteri Besar Datuk Mukhriz Mahathir reportedly said the Kedah government had got the green light from the federal government to move forward with its RM1.6 billion Kulim International Airport.Taking a look at MAHB’s financial performance in the past several years, it is easy to see why private investors and state governments are vying for a piece of the lucrative airport management market. The airport operator’s net profit growth has accelerated for three straight years since the financial year ended Dec 31, 2015 (FY2015), while revenue has grown for four straight years. Its net profit jumped 3.4 times year on year to RM699.21 million in the first nine months ended Sept 30, 2018, and revenue increased 5.7% y-o-y to RM3.6 billion.The only other airport operator is MMC Corp Bhd, via its subsidiary Senai Airport Terminal Services Sdn Bhd (SATSSB), which manages the Senai International Airport in Johor and Kertih Airport in Terengganu. According to the Companies Commission of Malaysia, SATSSB posted a net profit of RM161.54 million on revenue of RM373.74 million in FY2014 ended Dec 31. However, its net profit has since shrunk 96.2% to RM6.1 million in FY2017, while revenue contracted 84.5% to RM58.11 million.But beneath the allure of a lucrative business, Maybank Kim Eng Securities associate director Mohshin Aziz points out that airport operators like MAHB and SATSSB operate in a highly regulated industry in which aeronautical charges are set by the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom).“So, although MAHB has a near-monopoly in the airport sector, it cannot set its own charges,” he tells The Edge.And not all of its 39 airports are profitable. Only seven are currently making a profit — namely, KLIA, Penang, Langkawi, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Subang and Miri. The 18 short take-off and landing ports that connect rural areas are loss-making and cross-subsidised by MAHB’s profitable airports.“So, new airport operators will also need to cross-subsidise within their clusters because they will operate under the same rules, and they cannot just close down airports that are not profitable,” says an industry expert.“And if privatising airports is something the government is considering, as it is in no position to fund future airport developments, then it should do so by open tender as in other countries,” he adds.Still, Maybank Kim Eng’s Mohshin is of the view that breaking up airports into clusters and roping in more operators to manage them will enable the operators to be more focused on their assets.“Under the current framework, there is disproportionate growth across the 39 airports as MAHB cannot focus evenly on all of them. It focuses on profitable or the most-in-need airports. At the other end, there are airports that have not seen any progress or development.“If the current structure does not change, airport expansion will continue to be done on a sporadic or ad-hoc basis, with no 5- or 10-year plan kind of focus,” he adds.Mohshin reckons that through the clustering of airports, MAHB can focus on the central cluster. “Likewise, whoever takes the other clusters can focus on those other airports.”The important point here is that the clustering of airport operations by region is not bad per se, but that the devil is in the execution. “An airport must be undertaken by an operator who is pro-growth, is dexterous and has a strategy in driving shareholder value,” says Mohshin.A process that is rushed through behind closed doors would not be beneficial to existing airports and the sector. Enough airports in MalaysiaMohshin says there are already enough airports in the country. What is lacking is cross-airport coverage, such as Penang-Terengganu and Penang-Kelantan flights.Citing the new Kulim International Airport, he expects it to erode Penang airport’s profitability due to their proximity to each other. Nonetheless, despite being given the go-ahead to build, the Kedah government would need to get an operating licence for Kulim airport from Mavcom before it can open its doors to airlines and passengers.Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics, concurs, adding that 40 airports are “way too many” for a population of about 33 million and about 26 million in tourist arrivals, based on last year’s figures.He believes some of the smaller airports — such as Mersing and Alor Setar — should be closed down as the number of passengers passing through does not justify retaining them. “The cross-subsidisation of loss-making airports from the profitable airports should stop. The question is whether we have the political will to shut them down.”As such, Shukor does not see the economic benefits or cost advantages of building low-cost carrier terminals (LCCT) in Penang and Kota Kinabalu.“The cost of operating airports in the two cities is already low. So, there is no need to have a dedicated LCCT. The existing airports can service [the low-cost traffic].“Take Chiang Mai and Phuket, for example. Even though their number of tourist arrivals is higher than Penang, they use existing airports,” he adds.While he believes the plan to break up MAHB’s near monopoly on operating airports is a good move, as many are not making money, Shukor says this is not the right time to address this issue.“The clustering of airports is workable, except that Malaysia is not big enough for this. The more pressing issue is to make airports more profitable — or profitable — and to put politics aside.“For example, there is still a lot of potential to grow Senai International Airport. As such, it makes more sense to focus on Senai rather than clustering,” he says, adding that ideas like a new airport in Kulim are also not helpful for the country.Last year, Senai airport handled a record 3.52 million passengers, a 13% increase from 2017. Currently, there are five airlines operating in Senai International Airport, serving 12 domestic and seven international destinations. Need for national aviation master planMavcom executive chairman Dr Nungsari Radhi says there is a need to come up with a national aviation master plan that addresses matters such as the number of airports required in the country, projection of future air traffic, how the airports will integrate with other modes of transport — such as land and maritime — in an integrated transport chain and the funding models for the development of airports.“The aviation master plan is part of a larger national transport policy,” he tells The Edge. “The airport funding model forms part of the aviation master plan and will be applicable to both existing and new airports. This is important if the government is considering private-sector participation to fund airport expansion or new airport infrastructure going forward,” explains Nungsari.“Under the airport funding model, two moving parts that need to be solved are the OA (between the airport operator and the government) and the aeronautical charges including the passenger service charge (PSC) that operators can impose. A private investor may go to the capital markets to raise funding to build an airport and, therefore, they want an OA that matches their requirements,” he says.On the part of Mavcom, it has been tasked to come out with a framework called the Regulated Assets Base (RAB) that will set the rates according to the facilities and expenditure required of an airport.Nungsari says the completion of the RAB is taking longer than expected as the commission has to ascertain how much has been spent on the various airports by the government and MAHB.“On top of that, we need to know how much the operator(s) will spend going forward, which will depend on their traffic projections and so on.“We are in the final stages of putting those numbers together and we hope to complete the RAB this year,” he says.Pressure continues to mount on Mavcom to bring down the PSC, particularly from low-cost carrier AirAsia Group Bhd, which maintains that the services provided by KLIA and klia2 are not comparable.“We are aware of this. That is why we have to find a basis to determine the PSC for the different airports. (Until the RAB is completed) we cannot simply reduce the PSC because it will affect the existing players,” says Nungsari.According to Nungsari, the RAB must be clear for investors and companies like MAHB to invest in and operate airports in the country. “You cannot just change like that.

Traveloka has not acted in good faith. They have refused to provide an official explanation despite our repeated attempts to seek their clarification.""The exclusion of several AirAsia Indonesia flights by Traveloka is a clear display of preferential treatment and an act of favouritism.

Therefore, in solidarity, AirAsia Group withdraws sales of all of its flights from Traveloka effective immediately,” Dendy said.AirAsia's statement alleged that its flights first disappeared from Traveloka on Feb 14-17 2019, coinciding with AirAsia’s network-wide system upgrade on Feb 16 2019.  AirAsia alleged that Traveloka had cited the 13-hour system downtime as the reason for AirAsia flights disappearing from their website in response to queries from customers.AirAsia claimed that its flights disappeared from Traveloka for a second time on Saturday (March 2) without clarification, well after the successful system upgrade by AirAsia.Dendy said: “Competition should be free and fair to ensure consumers benefit from the best deals.

This translates into a payout ratio of 108%.The record high dividend, however, did not seem to lend much support to the carrier’s share price which has been on the decline since a year ago. Probably more attention has been drawn to its largest ever quarterly net loss.AirAsia last week announced that due to higher fuel costs and operating lease expenses, it posted a net loss of RM394.97 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (4QFY18), compared to a net profit of RM372.6 million a year ago, although its quarterly revenue had grown 6.2% at RM2.82 billion.Bloomberg data shows a quarter of the 20 research houses that cover AirAsia have downgraded their ratings the day after the quarterly results announcement, leaving the airline with eight “buy” calls, and six each for “hold” and “sell” calls.Some RM6.21 billion market capitalisation has evaporated since March 1 last year, when its price was at an all-time high of RM3.85 apiece, valuing AirAsia at RM15.37 billion. Last Friday, it ended at RM2.74, giving it a market capitalisation of RM9.16 billion.AirAsia, despite the large quarterly losses, was profitable for FY18 with an annual profit of RM1.97 billion or 59.2 sen per share, compared with RM1.62 billion, or 49.3 sen per share.Excluding a laundry list of one-off items, for example foreign exchange gain of RM130.8 million, fair value loss on derivatives of RM200.2 million, one-off expenses relating to BBAM (Ltd Partnership) of RM146 million, and provision for doubtful third-party charter debts of RM60 million, AirAsia recorded a FY18 core net profit of RM838.6 million, according to Public Invest Research, which has an “outperform” call on the airline.The research outfit pegs its target price (TP) at RM3.70, which is 35% above against last Friday’s closing of RM2.74.To recap, in March last year, AirAsia announced the US$1.185 billion sales and leaseback deal to divest wholly-owned aircraft leasing unit Asia Aviation Capital Ltd (AACL) to BBAM.Fernandes also commented in the tweet massage that the divestment of AACL was “fantastic”, as it locked in the aircraft’s residual value and beef up AirAsia’s balance sheet, while enabling it to pay out generous dividend.Nomura analyst, Ahmad Maghfur Usman, is upbeat on AirAsia’s earnings outlook “on the back of lower fuel costs coupled with the turnaround from its Asean affiliates, while losses from India are expected to narrow on improved scalability as passenger volumes increase”.Maghfur’s TP of RM5.20 is the highest among analysts polled by Bloomberg.He noticed that AirAsia has been more disciplined in terms of capacity management for Malaysia and Indonesia to drive up yield and boost load factor.Higher yield and load factor are what all airlines looking for simply because these will help widen profit margin.However, CIMB Research analyst Raymond Yap holds a contrast view on Asia’s biggest low-cost carrier, whose share price has declined nearly 29% from the peak.In the financial result review dated Feb 28, Yap wrote that AirAsia is likely to incur higher provisions for aircraft maintenance charges compared to the time before the sale and leaseback model take place.“All else being equal, the squeeze on AirAsia’s profitability will continue to get tighter since a substantial number of AirAsia’s order book with Airbus has been committed for subsequent sale and leaseback with BBAM.“With lower profitability, AirAsia will be less resilient to the unexpected changes in the business environment,” Yap commented, adding that competition may intensify as Malaysia Airlines Bhd and Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd are expected to increase capacity.Yap, who has a “reduce” call and a TP of RM1.82 on AirAsia, also cautioned that the new airport departure levy and the potential passenger service charge increase are expected to hurt travel demand in Malaysia, which might resulting AirAsia to subsidise these rate increases.When contacted, Maybank Investment Bank aviation analyst, Mohshin Aziz, told The Edge Financial Daily that as competition intensify, AirAsia’s pricing power would be substantially lower.“Beyond that, a lot of their costs have increased. The aircraft operating lease cost, in particular, was quite painful to the company, it had increased more than what we have led to believe,” he said.Although Mohshin said AirAsia management has said that the worst may have been over and the Malaysian airline industry is seeing a slow recovery, but his own observation seems to suggest that airfares are still in a cheap environment.Mohshin has a “sell” call on AirAsia, with a fair value of RM2.28. He does not rule out that selling pressure may persist for a while longer.Analysts have various views on the prospects of AirAsia. Some are paying attention on dark clouds on the horizon, while others see the silver lining behind the dark clouds.All said, Fernandes reiterated that “time will tell” that AirAsia is on the right path to greater height.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fernandes-2019-will-be-best-year,"2019-05-01 20:09:38"

The plan may not go ahead, they cautioned. A spokesman for Airbus declined to comment.Airbus previously offered to build its A380 superjumbo in China in exchange for orders from the country’s airlines, but that pitch was rejected amid concerns about the double-decker plane’s suitability for the local market, according to two of the people. The smaller, more fuel-efficient A330neo is potentially a better fit, with more than 200 of the original-generation model already sold in the Asian nation.Building wide-body jets in China would boost Airbus’s challenge to Boeing Co., which opened a so-called completion center near Shanghai last year but has so far held off from assembling planes in the country. Manufacturers face a balancing act in transferring technology to China, which is set to become the world’s biggest aviation market next decade but is also seeking to build up its own know-how as a prelude to challenging Western dominance in aerospace production.Airbus’s move to extend the Tianjin plant -- which currently assembles the single-aisle A320 workhorse -- comes as Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc is said to be offering to establish a Chinese plant to secure a deal to supply engines for the wide-body plane being developed by Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. The U.K. manufacturer is pitching a derivative of the Trent 7000 turbine for that aircraft, which is also the only option on the A330neo.Rolls-Royce Said to Offer China Engine Plant to Win Deal on JetBiggest MarketChina will need almost 8,000 aircraft worth $1.2 trillion over 20 years, according to Boeing estimates. President Xi Jinping has also earmarked aerospace as a priority industry, encouraging foreign producers to set up shop in the country, though both the U.S. company and Airbus are still a long way from offering the kind of expertise found at their factories in Seattle and Toulouse, France.The assembly plant for the A330neo -- abbreviated from new engine option -- would add to an existing completion and delivery center for Airbus’ original A330, where planes get final touches before being shipped to the customers.The upgraded aircraft entered service last year but has been battling for orders with Boeing’s more advanced 787 Dreamliner. Airbus has secured sales for 230 A330-900s but just eight smaller -800s, losing contracts from Hawaiian Airlines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. along the way as they switched to the Boeing aircraft.Toulouse, France-based Airbus has since won a 40-jet deal from Emirates, though only after the Dubai carrier canceled the bulk of its orders for the A380, which Airbus announced earlier this month was being wound up. The company is also targeting a follow-on contract for 44 planes from Malaysia’s AirAsia that was announced but never signed. - Bloomberg",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/airbus-said-consider-making-newest-jet-china-win-orders,"2019-05-01 20:09:41"

Talk that Khazanah might be liquidated was why congratulations was not the first word that came to mind for many when Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan was plucked out of the highly successful Employees Provident Fund to fill the managing director’s seat at Khazanah in early August last year.Not only was it about a week after the entire Khazanah board had tendered their resignation, but Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had lamented how the sovereign wealth fund he set up in 1993 had veered away from its original purpose.One does not need a degree from Oxford or master’s from Cambridge, like Shahril has,  to know the 48-year-old needs to know upfront what Mahathir expects of him and Khazanah.“He just wanted assurance that I would be able to deliver in terms of success for Khazanah in the same way that I’ve done in the past for, say, EPF,” Shahril tells The Edge.Mahathir was also the prime minister when Shahril first came under Corporate Malaysia’s spotlight 18 years ago when he and Datuk Abdul Rahman Ahmad — now Permodalan Nasional Bhd president and CEO — were brought in to restructure the then debt-laden Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) in 2001.What is perhaps Shahril’s largest feat to date is how he successfully rebalanced the EPF’s portfolio of assets to earn a lot more income than what they would have earned had he not directed more money outside Malaysia into dividend-paying stocks as well as alternative investments such as real estate and infrastructure, which provide a steady stream of income without taking on excessive risks.The portfolio rebalancing allowed the EPF to pay the highest dividend rate in 21 years last year of 6.9%, despite the amount required to pay 1% dividend having doubled from RM3.43 billion when he joined the EPF as deputy CEO of investments in November 2009 to RM7.02 billion in 2017. Shahril was EPF CEO from April 2013 until the Aug 3 announcement stating he would report for duty at Khazanah on Aug 20, 2018.Now, Shahril will be expected to rebalance Khazanah’s portfolio — not short-term selling of assets or shares to fill government coffers — but to turn Khazanah into a significant income generator for Malaysia — one that can sustainably supplement the federal government’s annual budget.“There has been this misconception that we are selling because the government needs money. Actually, that is not quite true. We are actually doing some disposals in order to rationalise the portfolio. For instance, we are highly concentrated in terms of our Malaysian exposure. From a more balanced point of view, we really should have more global exposure,” Shahril explains.“What we’re trying to do is to give more certainty to what we can deliver for government budgeting purposes. That commitment of about RM1 billion [dividend] a year is that certainty that we’re giving them,” he adds, explaining that the bulk of proceeds from any divestment stays in Khazanah for reinvestment to restructure its portfolio for longer-term gains.“As we restructure the portfolio and the portfolio starts to provide and generate the kind of returns that we think it should over the long term, that would give us more capacity, at that point in time, to look at a higher dividend to the government.”Indeed, the RM1 billion dividend the government expects from it for 2019 was what Khazanah paid the government in 2017, and lower than the RM1.5 billion Shahril said Khazanah paid in 2018. [It is understood that there is a discrepancy between the dividend Khazanah reports and what is stated under the government’s income records as the latter is prepared using cash accounting rather than accrual accounting.]Across the Causeway, Singapore’s annual budget has been enjoying what it calls a net income return contribution (NIRC) since 2000,  which covered nearly 20% of the city state’s government expenses last year.  The NIRC includes 50% net investment returns from Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, GIC Pte Ltd and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.GIC and Temasek — with US$390 billion and US$375 billion assets under management (AUM) respectively — are the world’s eighth and ninth largest sovereign wealth funds, according to data from the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) Institute. GIC manages Singapore’s government reserves while Temasek is Singapore’s investment arm. SWF ranks Khazanah at No 25 with US$38.7 billion.According to Shahril, the biggest difference between Khazanah’s old and new mandate is “clarity on the long-term goal and vision”.Going forward, Khazanah’s portfolio will have a 70:30 split, with 70% of its assets falling under the “commercial” basket that is used to fulfil its long-term asset growth target. The remaining 30% will be its “strategic” basket, which, he says, fulfils a strategic role in the country’s development and encompasses Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airlines Bhd as well as Iskandar Investment Bhd.That leaves Khazanah’s previous core holdings such as Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd and its remaining 26% stake in IHH Healthcare Bhd in the “commercial” pool that it will monetise, if the right value exists. Citing its deal with Mitsui & Co on IHH, Shahril assures other investors that Khazanah will not make any move that is counterproductive to its own portfolio value.He also says Khazanah cannot simply apply a blanket 15% to 25% cap to all its holdings “because a lot depends on the maturity of the asset as well as the opportunity that exists for us to do some monetisation” but it will be actively assessing its portfolio going forward to reap the best possible benefits for Malaysia.Given the current portfolio constraints, Khazanah is looking at achieving 3% returns above inflation over a rolling five-year period, a target that will be relooked over time as the portfolio is reshaped — a journey that Shahril reckons could take seven to 10 years. Khazanah will also be managing costs more tightly. One example is that it did not need to pay investment banking fees for its IHH deal with Mitsui because the capability exists in-house.  For more on what he has to say about Khazanah’s new mandate, read the following interview: The Edge: How have your past six months at Khazanah been? What is your mandate and is it clear? Are your money-making skills going to be put to good use?Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan: When I stepped in at the end of August last year, it was a fairly abrupt shift from my previous position at EPF. But given that the Malaysian market is not that big and EPF and Khazanah have had many dealings in the past, the transition was fairly short. Obviously, I already knew quite a lot of people at Khazanah and we’d done some common investments in the past. Also, we more or less knew what was happening at Khazanah, so I would say it was a fairly steep learning curve in terms of the time that we had. But it was not something that was impossible to do, given that there was a lot of knowledge coming in already.So, the first thing that was quite apparent, that really needed to happen, I think, was to ensure that the new board and new government in place had a clear understanding of what Khazanah’s vision or mandate was going to be. I think, really, that’s the most important thing that needs to be upfront because for any organisation, if you’re not clear about what the expectations are or what the mandate is, it is very hard to work on the policies within the firm to take it forward.So, we worked on that upfront and I think we got a lot of clarity very early on in terms of my discussions with the government and the new board. By December, when we had our formal strategy review as well as our outlook for 2019, we formulated a very clear strategy, which was adopted [approved] by our board, so that’s the new Khazanah mandate.The Khazanah mandate is really twofold. One, Khazanah essentially should function like a traditional sovereign wealth fund for other countries, which is focused on the long-term growth of its assets on behalf of and for the benefit of all Malaysians over generations. So, that’s a much longer-term goal, which is about growth and about making sure that on a risk-adjusted basis, we reach the kind of targets and returns that we set for ourselves. But we also recognise the fact that Khazanah, over the years, has also played a developmental role, that is a strategic role for the government, and that continues as well. And that is focused really on our strategic side, about making the right investments and working with the government on regulations and the environment to make sure that beyond just a commercial objective, those strategic investments also fulfil a role in creating the right atmosphere and right infrastructure for Malaysia’s development and economic growth.When we look at that, essentially we think of Khazanah as having two pools of assets. One pool is focused on the long-term asset growth target. Internally, we call it our commercial fund. The other pool of assets — which focuses on Khazanah’s strategic role of helping develop Malaysia — is our strategic fund. The split between the two pools is roughly 70:30 — 70% is focused on long-term asset growth for Malaysians while 30% is focused on the strategic role that we reinforce. What is the biggest difference between the old and new mandates?It is clarity on Khazanah’s long-term goal and vision. The previous management was very focused on GLC (government-linked company) transformation and Khazanah did a fantastic job of raising the standard of the GLCs it was invested in and championing the regionalisation of Malaysian companies — with a lot of success. And if we look at the last 12 years or so, before I stepped in, it had seen a lot of success in terms of achieving those goals but really, as the organisation matures, you have to move forward because a lot of that work is done. We can’t keep focusing on that work; from the point of view of effort versus returns, most of it has been achieved but you will be on a path of diminishing returns if you keep focusing on the same strategy. I think that’s basically something that Khazanah itself recognises. To be fair, even before I stepped in, they’d already started thinking about taking all these steps, which is why it was quite easy to start the transition. Because really, it is about articulating where we go as an organisation. Khazanah’s pool of assets is fairly limited, at RM100-plus billion, and there is speculation that it will sell a lot of those assets and give the money back to the government. Will Khazanah be given any leeway in keeping some of the funds from monetising its assets and investing that for longer-term growth and returns? Singapore, for instance, has NIRC (net investment return contribution), which contributes about 20% to the government’s budget …One of the things we’ve worked on under the strategy adopted by the board is that when we look at Khazanah’s pool of assets and at our own requirements to restructure and balance the portfolio, we have fairly clear guidelines internally that for every divestment we make, a certain portion goes towards debt repayment, a certain portion towards reinvestment and from a government point of view, we now have a clear dividend policy. Last year, we committed about RM1 billion plus to the government as dividend and that is to be an ongoing and steady dividend policy. RM1 billion (dividend) every year?Roughly RM1 billion a year. If you look at the asset rationalisation that we’ve been doing, a lot of it is towards the fact that as we become a more mature commercial fund, the proceeds from the divestment are used for restructuring the portfolio.There is this misconception that we’re selling because the government needs money. That is not quite true. We are actually doing some disposals to rationalise the portfolio. If you look at our portfolio, quite clearly, there is some imbalance. For instance, we are highly concentrated in terms of our Malaysian exposure. From a more balanced point of view, we really should have more global exposure.Similarly, our concentration in certain companies, we felt basically that the time has come for us to actually look at diversifying our exposure. For instance, we did that IHH Healthcare transaction last year. That is a template for how we basically view the portfolio. When the opportunity arises for us to rationalise or dispose of certain assets, we will only do so if the value is right and the proceeds are used to reinvest and rebalance the portfolio.I think people tend to misunderstand because we (Khazanah) are owned by the government. They seem to think that every time we sell an asset, the proceeds go straight to the government. The proceeds actually stay in Khazanah for the purpose of reinvestment because its longer-term goal is to grow that pool of assets for the benefit of Malaysia as a whole.So, the dividend portion — yes, we have committed to a dividend policy to the government and that is reflected in the government’s budget itself where RM1 billion or so is anticipated from Khazanah on a yearly basis.What we’re trying to do is to give more certainty to what we can deliver for government budgeting purposes. That commitment of about RM1 billion a year is that certainty that we’re giving the government. Is that on an increasing basis, until you can get more? When do you think Khazanah can give more?The plan is that as we restructure the portfolio and it starts to generate the kind of returns we think it should over the long term, that would give us more capacity. At that point, we will look at a higher dividend to the government.But the focus right now is to restructure the portfolio because to have a proper balance between our exposure and the risks we’re taking, a lot of reinvestment needs to be done to restructure the portfolio now. So, there is no rush to sell assets?Not at all. There will come opportunities where it makes sense for us to consider a sale. IHH Healthcare was obviously one of those, where basically we’ve done a lot of work in terms of building up that regional champion and our partner Mitsui is very keen to play a bigger role in the company and we are quite happy to let it do so. So, we remain a partner in the company as well and we will keep working with Mitsui to grow the company. Khazanah was reported to be looking to keep only 15% to 25% stakes in companies and disposing of the rest to raise cash for the nation’s coffers …That story was not directly sourced from us (Khazanah), so there are some accuracy issues. So, there is no 15% to 25% (equity holding) limit? A number of your holdings have breached that level: 66% in UEM Sunrise, 37% in Axiata, 33% in MAHB, 27% in CIMB ...When you look at each of our assets, it is hard to apply a blanket rule like that because a lot depends on the maturity of the asset as well as the opportunity that exists for us to do some monetisation.In some cases, like IHH Healthcare, we would do a partial sale because we still believe in the long-term future of the asset. But like any good portfolio manager, when the opportunity exists for you to take some of your money because you’re clearly sitting on some fairly decent gains, you should exercise the financial discipline to do so and rebalance the portfolio. Otherwise, as the value of the asset keeps growing, it takes up a larger proportion of your total portfolio and from a risk-adjusted basis, it becomes a bit more difficult to justify having so many of your eggs in one basket.There will be opportunities for us to do a total sale — sometimes, if we feel that we’ve brought it as far as we think we can and that it might be better off in somebody else’s hands, and we can get good value for it, then we do a total sale. In some cases, like IHH Healthcare, we do a partial sale. In some instances, we might just continue to hold what we have today if we believe there is better value upside for us in doing so. So, it is not wise to assume that a blanket rule is applied to everything because it doesn’t make sense in a lot of cases. Will Khazanah be initiating more deals [to create/unlock value], such as merging companies or exercises like the airport REIT [which the government announced when tabling Budget 2019]?Depending on the entity and the market it is operating in, there are different opportunities. In some cases, a merger may be the best solution in terms of creating more value for us. In others, it may just be an outright sale. In yet others, it may purely be a focus on organic growth or if we think there are opportunities for us to put more money into the business for it to invest or to grow organically. It is very hard to over-generalise this. You would have seen many different forms in the market, through which value creation can take place. Are you going to merge Axiata with other companies — Telekom or perhaps Astro? Is that being considered or does its current [low] valuation make it very difficult?When we talk about mergers, you also have to be very careful about your own market position. I’m not talking about any company in particular but you have to also look at the fact that mergers sometimes may not be the solution because whenever you do a merger of two entities, you always have the problem of culture and integration. And that’s why from my point of view, you should always look at merger as a solution very, very carefully. Sometimes, those benefits, while they look good on paper, may actually be very difficult to achieve. A lot of the time when you look at a merger as a value creator, you are looking at cost synergies. Invariably, when you look at past mergers, those cost synergies become difficult to achieve because of inherent legacies or inherent problems, so you have to be very careful about pushing mergers as the main form of value creation. So, is there low-hanging fruit that you’re looking to tackle first?Yes, obviously, when we look at the portfolio, there are a number of things that we think we can do in terms of value creation and we will be actively pursuing that throughout the rest of this year. So, yes, there are a few opportunities, I think, but given market sensitivities, we can’t really discuss them in detail but we will make announcements as they come. From your portfolio review, how big a percentage of the assets are ripe for monetisation? Any non-performing assets that Khazanah needs to hive off?Clearly, in any portfolio, you always look at the return at portfolio level, as a whole. Within the portfolio, there are always those that are outperforming and those that are underperforming. So, Khazanah is no different. There are assets, which are clearly not performing to expectation.So, one of the things we hope to instill in Khazanah going forward is a much sharper attitude towards cutting losses early or getting out of situations before they become worse. That’s always one of the fundamental difficulties for any asset manager or portfolio manager, which is that sometimes, you tend to fall in love with the asset or investment. You have got to have more discipline in terms of reducing your losses early and accepting the fact that you can’t win them all. No portfolio manager has 100% success in investment. It is mathematically impossible but the more successful managers have the right culture in place, which allows them to basically identify losers or underperforming assets and make decisions fast enough to redeploy the capital into other assets where you have better opportunities.Similarly here in Khazanah, we are in the midst of looking at those underperforming assets and where we feel there is really no point in continuing — some foreign, some local. Even our global assets, we’ve had some real winners over the last year or so. We had, for instance, our investment in companies like FarFetch and Phunware, which have gone for listing and done well. Similarly, some of those tech investments — there’s always the danger of early-stage investment. You are bound to have some failures, and with those failures, we are just going to draw the line; we’re not going to pump in any more money because there is absolutely no point in good money chasing bad money. One of the assets that need a lot of money is Malaysia Airlines. Is it still going to be on Khazanah’s books?Yes. It is part of our strategic portfolio. In terms of commercial returns, we are encouraging the Malaysia Airlines board and management to close the gap in commercial outcome, but beyond that, Malaysia Airlines, for a very long time, also served a fundamental purpose for the Malaysian economy in terms of being the national carrier and promoting tourism, there are a lot of intangible and commercial benefits, which don’t necessarily accrue to the airline itself but to the country. This is why it sits in our strategic basket.Obviously, I think a lot more can be done to improve the commercial outcome of the airline itself but we have to recognise that there is — at this point in time and for a lot of national airlines around the world — a cost to maintain the benefit to the economy as a whole in terms of linkages and trade and so on. The key here is for the Malaysia Airlines board and management to think through and accept the fact that it is an extremely competitive world out there. They have to find a way to actually compete and do it commercially. Does this mean there could be additional help, apart from the previous plan that was announced?Well, they are in the midst of a review of the strategic plan they’ve in place and quite clearly, there are elements of the strategy that have worked and those that haven’t. What we’re asking them to focus on is that you have to be realistic to see what is working and what is not. For what is not working, you might as well do something different because there is really no point in trying to do the same thing over and over again, if it is really not working.So, we are waiting for them to come back to us. The onus is on the management and board to come back to the shareholders and say, ‘Look, we think this is going to be a more viable strategy’. Then, we will look at it and see whether or not we agree. There is talk that the RM6 billion is not enough and that it is up to the management and board to convince Khazanah that they are worth additional support and money until they make it ...Like I said, we’re waiting for them to come back to us. There is no point in pursuing a course of action that is not going to work in this business climate. If it is obviously not going to work, why do it? So, let’s wait and see.I think there are elements that they are already implementing, which have a better chance of success. They have launched AMAL, which is a specialised service for umrah and haj. That looks decent as a strategy. It plays to one of their competitive strengths. We’re asking them, ‘If you can think of things like AMAL, then surely you can think of strategies for your other businesses that are not performing well and look at doing something different?’ When are they due to come back on the plan?Hopefully, in a very short period of time. The aviation sector has become very complex because of the competition and quite clearly in Malaysia, you have a very clear market leader in low-cost airlines, which is AirAsia. The reality is that AirAsia now dominates that segment. So, the problem we’re facing is that it is very different from 20 years ago, when Malaysia Airlines was a monopoly. That’s not going to happen ever again. There is no point in pining for the good old days. You have to accept reality and move on. You mentioned a 70:30 split and Malaysia Airlines sits in the 30% (strategic) basket. Can we generalise and say that the 30% comprises the not-for-sale assets and whatever is in the 70%, if its potential is maxed out, you will just sell it?Yeah, if you look at it that way. I’ll be very frank with you. The strategic side encompasses TM, Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia Airports, our holdings in Malaysia Airlines, Iskandar, which is a catalytic development down south, and one or two small pieces in there like our tourism and resort business, which again, is a catalytic development for Malaysia in terms of encouraging growth in that area. Really, everything else is in our commercial side. So Axiata, UEM, Astro and CIMB … are in the 70%?Axiata, UEM Group, Astro, CIMB … that’s in our commercial fund. Our view, essentially, is that from a control point of view and from an influence point of view, we will remain focused in our strategic basket because those are the companies that I think makes more sense for us to spend time with [their] board and management in terms of regulatory outcomes because those have a bigger impact on Malaysia’s economy and infrastructure development. For the rest, really, the government has no interest or business influencing or being in control of private hospitals, or a commercial bank or a property development or building services. I think the right path, and our board agrees, is that these are businesses that really do not need government ownership or management. They should really be free to go and do their own thing. We will be purely an investor.As you yourself said, we have to recognise that when the right opportunity comes, we will look at whether we can create value for Khazanah by either disposing, merging or organic growth. So, it is fully a portfolio-based approach to those investments. We have heard the phrase ‘financial discipline’ a few times and you mentioned it alongside ‘loving the asset’ too much. Is that one of the shortcomings you found when you came in?I wouldn’t say it is a shortcoming. I think basically, it is just a natural path. Khazanah for the past 12 years has been focusing on revamping these companies and we’ve done a great job in terms of revamping. When you look at the amount of value created for companies like TM, Tenaga and CIMB over the last 10 to 12 years, it has been fantastic, right?Obviously, as the organisation matures, we have to recognise the fact that we’ve done our part. We now have professional boards, professional management at these companies. The onus now rests on those boards and managements to basically keep that value creation growing. Our role then shifts, as far as those companies are concerned, towards essentially being a capital allocator.If we feel that the nation’s capital, Khazanah’s assets, are best deployed in those companies, they will continue to be deployed in those companies. If there are other opportunities, we will redeploy somewhere else because the main goal of Khazanah going forward is really about long-term growth of our assets. If that long-term growth can be achieved by staying with these companies, fine. If not, we should really have the discipline to say we’ve taken it as far as we can, it’s time to take that money and the profits that we’ve made and redeploy them somewhere else. Is there a cap for Khazanah when it comes to foreign investments?There’s not so much a cap. If you look at our portfolio, we are short on global assets. The reason for that is we’ve always been very mindful … Traditionally, the GLICs [government-linked investment companies] have had an outsized presence in Malaysia, especially on Bursa Malaysia. When Khazanah looks at it, our point of view is basically, we already have EPF and PNB. They are very big local investors and rightly so because on their account are Malaysian holders who are expecting decent ringgit outcomes [returns].If the focus is really on long-term asset growth, then we have to have a more balanced portfolio that looks at both Malaysia as well as globally on the commercial side. The strategic side will always be Malaysia-focused, but on the commercial side, it needs to be more balanced in order to provide the right risk-adjusted returns. What kind of global assets are you looking at?It will be in line with our risk-return profile. The difference from say, the EPF — which has capital stability as one of its core goals and has a fairly large allocation towards debt and fixed income — is that Khazanah’s focus is more on growth. We are much more heavily focused on equities, a mix of both public as well as private equities.Our asset allocation going forward is roughly going to be about 60% public equities, 30% private equities and 10% real assets.The reason for that is we don’t have individual accounts to worry about but we focus more on longer-term growth, so the right measure for a fund like Khazanah — for our commercial fund — is effectively an inflation plus strategy measured over a rolling, say, five-year period. That’s really the focus we are working on and that’s what we’re going with. You say you are going to increase your overseas presence. Where is the ideal threshold?That will come over time. It’s not as easy as saying we’re going to do it because the bulk of our assets are still Malaysia-focused.When I mentioned that we need to rebalance the portfolio, essentially we need to rebalance it towards being more global. IHH Healthcare Bhd is a good example. A large portion of the money from the transaction will go towards our global exposures. We will rebalance gradually over time.We think, honestly, from where our portfolio is and where the markets are, you’re probably looking at a seven to 10-year journey before we actually get to that ideal situation. We are talking about a capital outflow over time?Yeah, very gradual. Over a seven to 10-year period, it’s something that will allow that growth in global assets. So right now, it is like 30%?We are less than that actually, we are only about 15%. So your contract is for five or 10 years?No, CEO contracts should never be that long. My contract is only for three years from Aug 20, 2018. Back to dividends. The number was RM1.5 billion last year and it’s RM1 billion this year. How does Khazanah decide on the amount? Petronas, for instance … there is their net income. If the oil price is above US$70 a barrel, people know Petronas is in a good position to pay more dividends. In Khazanah’s case, how do you assess whether you’re in a position to pay more?As part of our strategic review, we have an internal dividend policy in place and that looks forward for the year. We already know what’s in our pipeline in terms of what we are planning to do or what is already on the way. We have a fairly decent idea of the kind of proceeds we will be generating and a percentage of that will be for dividends. What’s the percentage?It is roughly about 20% of the net proceeds from our transactions and the deals we’ve done. You’re not under pressure from the government to declare higher dividends?To be fair, I think the government understands there is always a trade-off between short-term dividends versus long-term portfolio rebalancing. There is a danger that if you try to extract too much money upfront, it leaves very little money for rebalancing the portfolio and that would then affect the long-term viability of Khazanah and the portfolio itself.So, one of the things that we’ve been very eager to do is have that discussion and emphasise basically the fact that you do need to allow space for that rebalancing, which would then allow you to, in future years, have a better outcome as far as dividends are concerned. Otherwise, what happens when you’re too short-termish and try to extract money from the portfolio, you are basically jeopardising that ultimate objective. The government understands the position?Yes, and that’s why our projected dividends for this year is roughly RM1 billion. The 20% is from disposal, or is it after it is in your books?When we look at net proceeds, obviously we have a cost to run Khazanah as well, so while we focus on the proceeds portion, one of the key objectives that we will be looking at here is also making Khazanah more cost-efficient. When we look at that, we have to benchmark properly against other similar funds. The whole idea is that we should be running at roughly 30 basis points (bps) for AUM (assets under management). We were running at higher than that in the last few years. How much higher?Probably 15bps to 20bps higher. So, one of the key things we are focusing on this year is to drive down running costs. Are you going to shut down some of the regional offices or downsize?Obviously, we are reviewing a lot of our cost structure where it makes sense. It has to be appropriate to our objective as well, what we intend to do in terms of redeployment. So yes, in some instances, we will downsize our operations. That’s only natural. In certain areas, the cost may not justify what we’re trying to achieve. It seems that the prime minister is not so happy that some officers, including those in Khazanah, were being paid at investment banker’s scale. Has there been any feedback from the Prime Minister’s Department on salaries and remuneration?One of the key things when looking at remuneration is the fact that it has got to commensurate with the type of jobs and skills that we want to attract. From my point of view, you also have to be mindful that you’re expecting these people to generate value for you. You have to pay people appropriately.I do agree that, basically, we shouldn’t have excessive remuneration. In any organisation, that just doesn’t make sense, but you need to pay people for the kind of value that they are bringing.Generally, when we look at remuneration, it is in line with the financial industry. So, obviously, if you compare it to maybe a pure government-type agency, it would not be like that. But the whole idea is if you’re expecting people from investment banking or asset management to join you, then you have to basically provide them with a commensurating financial package. Otherwise, you’re not going to get them. It is the same for all fund managers, whether it is Khazanah, EPF and PNB. You are competing for a talent pool that is essentially mobile and that can go work in any investment bank or asset management house.The key difference with an entity like Khazanah is that we also have the element of national pride and national duty. So that helps, I think, in attracting a different kind of talent, those who wants to contribute to the country, who may not be focusing on remuneration as the No 1 objective. But to be fair to these people, you still have to pay them. You may not pay them at the top quartile of the financial industry but you’ve got to pay them at the average for them to come in. Did you have to take a pay cut to come in or are they banking on your love for country?Let’s put it this way lah, I’ve been doing national service for the last don’t know how many years now and I personally quite enjoy working and contributing towards this kind of organisation. So I’m one of those guys who have never been particularly motivated by remuneration. You’ve been here six months. Where is the fat in terms of cost?When you look at cost as a whole, there are elements where quite clearly, you can do a lot better. To be fair to the team here, they’ve already initiated those measures in the past. We are in the midst of doing full cost review. We think we can get to about 35bps this year. Is that coming from people or more [closing] offices?It’s a combination of a number of things. Some of it is fixed cost, office cost as well as infrastructure or system cost. Second is basically variable cost or deal cost. There we just need to be smarter about how we execute deals in order to reduce cost. IHH is a prime example. For the IHH transaction, everything was effectively in-house. So, we effectively didn’t have to pay investment bankers to do the deal. That capability does exist.Coming back to the issue of remuneration, it’s basically a balance between paying the right price to get the right people on board and then making sure that those people deliver value. In this case, the team basically in-housed the whole transaction, [the deal was done] without having to pay unnecessary investment banking fees. An early statement from Tun Mahathir, when the new government took over, was that Khazanah has veered away from its original objective. Have you had a chance to meet with the prime minister to clarify?Of course, he is the chairman of the board. He is fully involved in the discussion on the approval of the new strategy by the board. To be fair to him, he is correct. The Khazanah that was set up in the 1990s was a very different animal — it was effectively a holding company, holding shares for the government. But over the course of time, like all organisations, those objectives change over time.In the 2000s right to the time I took over, that objective then became about enhancing the value of those assets, instead of being just a passive holder of those assets. It became more active in actually creating value by getting the right values, right systems, into those companies, and that has been a success. And the government has actually benefited from that. The government has actually reaped the value increase of companies like TM, Tenaga, CIMB and the rest.Now, the new strategy reflects what Khazanah will become over the next few years. Khazanah has changed and, like all organisations, will continue to change as we develop and mature. From the earlier statements, it seems that the prime minister wanted Khazanah to change back to its original purpose. Was that the indication?The government has basically approved the strategy, the board has approved the strategy. That’s a reflection that Khazanah has got this new mandate and vision. We will execute this new mandate and vision. This vision is different from what it was two years ago, it is different from what it was 20 years ago, but I think it is the right vision and mandate for what Khazanah should be going forward for the country. One of the largest impediments for Khazanah is the limited fund size of less than RM200 billion. When it is split to 60:30:10, the pool is even smaller and you already have a basket of things that you can’t really move. Are you using these three years to expand the pool? Is there a chance of getting more from the government by saying, we can get this much returns, give us the money?One of the natural constraints, as you rightly pointed out, is unlike the more traditional sovereign wealth funds, we don’t have a ready pool of AUM [funds] coming into Khazanah. That’s why Khazanah, especially in the last 10 years, has grown through using some debt to fund new purchases and organically growing the value of those assets. That was the strategy that was put in place.Going forward, we recognise the fact that government finances are currently a bit constrained. They are doing some restructuring of their finances. To expect the government to be able to commit new assets over the short-term would be difficult but obviously, as we put this [new] strategy in place, over the long term, we will be working with the government to see whether there are opportunities for us to manage more assets. But that is something that is not a short-term priority. Short-term priority really is the portfolio rebalancing and restructuring and we will move forward with that first. On your new mandate, [one newswire] had the headline “More cash less control”.More cash is generally a bad idea because cash gives you little returns. So while it is a catchy headline, it is very bad from an investment point of view, unless you’re willing to have a large cash drag on your portfolio.We basically have two clear mandates. One is on the commercial side, which is on the bulk of our assets — it is really about long-term, inflation-adjusted growth for the country and that’s focused on delivering long-term asset growth for the nation.On the strategic side … while focusing on commercial returns, it is [also] making sure that those assets continue to perform their role of strategically of helping the country to grow the economy as well as providing the right regulatory environment for other players to participate and compete. In terms of cutting losses, do you find it easier to do in EPF or Khazanah?The asset mixes and the concentration risks are very different. The EPF has been operating as a portfolio investor for a very long time. It is actually easier for them [EPF] because concentration are very small, amounts may be big, but concentration as a percentage of the entity is very small.For Khazanah, because a lot of our assets are sticky or lumpy, even if you wanted to dispose, it is normally a much longer process because we have a lot more liquidity constraints, for instance. Given how much share prices have come down, and you need to raise cash to do some of the portfolio restructuring, are you thinking [along the lines] of, say, a share-backed exchangeable bond?Financial markets are very sophisticated now, there are many different ways we can monetise or generate the kind of liquidity that we need. We’re actually quite comfortable with where it is. Markets have come down and there is a significant loss in value, especially over the last one year, in a number of our core asset holdings for various reasons, sometimes due to very significant regulatory change, like in the case for TM, where values today basically reflect a very different regulatory and operating environment. So, when we look at the portfolio as a whole, there are some areas where we obviously have more leeway or latitude to try and do things. In some areas, a bit more constrained. We have to accept that. That’s why it is important to have a diversified portfolio, because that gives you more ability to adjust for market conditions. When a portfolio is overly concentrated, then you are a hostage to both the market as well as the operating environment. It sounds like you’re reshaping Khazanah to be a portfolio investor. How do you rank this particular challenge compared to previous challenges in your previous roles?Like I said, every role has different challenges. Here, I think the challenge is not so much one of size. Yes, size is a constraint. Actually, the biggest constraint is more liquidity and concentration of risk. That’s actually the biggest challenge. Not so much size.And that is something which has to be addressed carefully because obviously, when you are the largest shareholder of an entity, any move that you make can be counterproductive to your value. And therefore, you have to do transactions or investments in a way which basically makes sense to your holdings as a whole.IHH is a classic example. Before we did the IHH transaction, the IHH share price was languishing, due to various reasons, at a fairly low level. But as soon as we made that transaction, it was very clear to the market that it was one transaction we were going to do ... the share overhang disappeared, the transaction itself set a new benchmark in terms of where the market perceived value of IHH and the share price then rerated, which benefited the balance holdings that we have as well.So you have to be careful, I think, in structuring this kind of transaction to make sure that you’re not shooting yourself in the foot. So you’ll be looking for people or investors or strategic partners that would recognise value in your assets, right?Obviously. Because I think if you adopt a strategy of just trying to dispose into the market, one, you create a massive share overhang, especially given the fact that in some of these companies, you are the largest shareholder. If we try to do a market disposal, once we just signal the intention into the market that you are a seller, suddenly people look at the shares and say no point buying, there’s a giant block of shares waiting to come into the market.So, in some instances, you just have to be patient, you find the right deal, and then that right deal essentially addresses the share overhang issue, addresses the market valuation issue at the same time, and gives you basically the ability to monetise a portion. Do you have another partner [like Mitsui for IHH] for your other assets?Not at this time. Obviously, there are things we are looking at and some discussions we are having but like I said, we’ll make announcements as it happens. Some news reports mentioned Japanese money coming into Khazanah.I think maybe they drew from the fact that Mitsui had come in for IHH and kind of extended that line a bit further maybe. When you say inflation-adjusted growth, would it be the country’s projected GDP growth for a particular year plus inflation?What we’re looking at is basically average inflation over a rolling five year period plus 3%. That seems conservative [low] for a fund that’s focused on growthIt reflects the fact that our current portfolio is constrained in terms of what we can do. So over time, as the portfolio is reshaped, those targets would be reviewed and relooked at again. Otherwise, there is no point in setting an unachievable or unrealistic target.We have to be a realist. We have to work within the constraint of the portfolio today. Inflation plus 3%, I think, is a reasonable and achievable target, without necessitating us to take unnecessary risk, given the fact that we have constraints on how much we can actually move the portfolio at this point. As you rebalance your portfolio, will the Bumiputera equity factor be one that will shape that rebalancing process?There are always going to be opportunities for entrepreneurs or management teams to look at being part of the process. Khazanah has done that in the past as well, with Time dotCom and other companies. So we will always look at that as well. Part of the vision of Khazanah, in terms of national development as a whole is how we create the right entrepreneur class to participate in the economy. There will be opportunities but it would be dependent on what type of asset it is. Something that is very big, like an IHH, that’s going to be more difficult because that’s much more of an institutional-type asset. But I guess there are smaller pieces in our portfolio which may be sole businesses or solo line businesses, which we will give opportunities for entrepreneurs or maybe the management team to propose a buyout of those assets. Your 60:30:10, that’s the target in seven to 10 years. What does it look like now?Right now it’s very much public markets but within the public markets, it is very concentrated because the bulk of our assets are reflected in under 10 companies. So that’s why transactions like IHH are important. It allows us to derisk our portfolio a bit by taking some of the AUM out of a single company and reinvesting in a broader spectrum of stuff. So the whole idea, over the seven to 10 years, we need to restructure and do something that makes more sense in terms of achieving the objective. The private equity part will be the 30%. What is it now?10% or so. Real assets?Real assets are very small, about 5%. Will you be looking at more real estate deals, when you talk about real assets? Is that going to be faster or longer-term when you get more assets to manage from the government?No. As part of the portfolio restructuring, we will start to deploy money in the different areas. Certainly, over time, we will see a shift in that portfolio… Do you count PLUS as a real asset?PLUS is more of an infrastructure asset. It is kind of a hybrid, it sits somewhere between our private equity and real assets basket. Would you say Khazanah internally is well-equipped for a much heavier foreign presence in terms of investments?We have many good people here who are very focused on the investment part. We will do a bit of supplementing on that because, quite clearly, as we build capacity in things like public markets, we will build capacity there as well. We are pretty okay. You come from EPF, which has RM800 billion and now you have a portfolio constraint. Would you count this as your toughest job ever [to date]?Every job has its own challenges. So, obviously, managing RM800 billion has its own challenges, where do you find enough investments to fill that entire pot and do it in a way that you’re still managing risk and generating the right returns.Here, it is a slightly different challenge. The biggest challenge to Khazanah at this point in time is how do we restructure and rebalance the portfolio while maintaining financial discipline in terms of making sure we get the right value for any divestment that we do and at the same time, recognising the fact that we have to be faster in either cutting losses out or disposing non-viable assets.Skill-set wise, it is transferable. It is the same philosophies in terms of trying to make sure that people understand that risk and return needs to be managed.That is why the first real thing that we needed to do here is clearly understand what is the right vision and mandate moving forward. Once that is set, then you can work on other things, what is your risk appetite, what is your philosophy, what is the asset allocation strategies because all that flows from that part. And that part really is about crystallising the idea that Khazanah really has two mandates, and these two mandates require separate consideration about what’s right and suitable. Last year, during the annual review, Khazanah said you have a China portfolio and that made quite a bit of money. Are you going to dedicate more funds into something like that?China, for instance, has been a big success for us. What is more important going forward is understanding how that fits into the overall larger portfolio, making sure that we have the right risk-return on the portfolio as a whole and within the individual portfolio is making sure that we are not overly weighted on tech and venture cap versus, say, consumers, versus financials … The whole idea is that when you start to think through these issues, you want to achieve a better overall portfolio return for the amount of risk we are taking. How’s the staff morale since the change of guard?Well, obviously, as in any organisation, when you have a sudden change of leadership, there’s always going to be anxiety as well as uncertainty over what’s going to happen.Hopefully, I think with the new strategy in place, the board approvals have all been done and the fact that everybody in there is now working towards a strategy, at least the uncertainty as to where the firm is heading has been resolved. But like in any change of strategy, there is going to be some anxiety about whether the individuals themselves are capable of executing that strategy. But that’s something you can actually work on over time, so we’re just like, all the strategic changes that I’ve put into place, you have to focus on making sure that you’re also focused on the human capital part and the development part to make sure that people understand their role in the new strategy. What was the first thing that your chairman said to you in the first meeting?He just wanted assurance that I would be able to deliver, in terms of success, for Khazanah in the same way that I’ve done in the past for, say, EPF, in making sure that we can actually create the right strategy for the organisation, which will then deliver success for the organisation.So, really, I think more along the lines of just getting assurance that the right strategy will be thought of and that management will be redirected in the right way. So I think, that’s the first part, which is basically, management and board on the same page as to where the firm should be going.And that’s been done, so now I think there’s no more uncertainty or lack of clarity as to where the firm should be headed. It’s now all about execution. So, given that the airport REIT was announced in the budget, is that the first big deal happening this year?No, actually, on the airport side, I think — and this is something that you really have to discuss with Malaysia Airports more — but I would imagine that their focus really is on resolving the regulatory framework first.Because without a clear regulatory framework in place, you can’t actually do any kind of asset monetisation because investors coming in want to have certainty about what their returns are going to be like. So that needs to happen first. TM is in your strategic portfolio. Have you got clarity on what the government actually wants to do?Yes. TM and the ministry, I think, have been sitting down a lot to really narrow the gap on expectations and in terms of where the regulatory framework is going to go.As a shareholder, we will also engage with the ministry to make sure that they understand and appreciate the fact that for the right investment to happen in any industry, whether it’s telco or anything else, you need to have clarity on your regulatory side because investors need to know how much you’re going to make from the investments that you’re putting in.And if the regulations or regulatory framework is not conducive, then nobody’s going to fund anymore expansion, because from a calculation point of view, why would I fund a billion ringgit of capital into that industry if I’m not going to get the same kind of return as I would expect putting it somewhere else. So you’re not expected to do national service in terms of TM?No, you have to be very careful about that because I think these are all public-listed companies and there’s a very big market implication, as you’ve seen with TM, if investors lose confidence in the regulatory framework. And then what will happen is it becomes very hard to raise new money for the industry. Has this been communicated to the respective ministries?Yes, I think that ongoing engagement is happening all the time and, to be fair, obviously government will have its own policy objectives. I think the job of the companies operating in those spaces is to properly advise the regulators on what are the financial or market implications of the various options that they’re looking at.Ultimately, it rests with the government. And if the government decides that it wants to implement a particular policy direction, it’s really their prerogative, but they need to do so, I think, in full knowledge of all the financial and market implications.Ultimately, the regulators have the right to set a policy direction. But they need to be very aware of the implications. So, what can the market expect from Khazanah this year? Because when you announce last year’s results (on Feb 28), the numbers are probably not going to look so good.Yes we’re planning to do our annual announcement, probably at the end of the month or so, and generally speaking … the market’s been performing very badly and some of our companies, TM in particular, and Axiata, for instance, and the telco industry as a whole have been very badly hit by regulatory uncertainty. So that, of course, will have a very big negative impact on results, clearly, because the market itself was difficult last year. The number of transactions that Khazanah could execute last year was also very limited.So you’ll probably not see a great result from Khazanah, and you’re going to have to accept that it’s just market reality. But the whole point, I think, is that we’ll refocus on the rebalancing and the portfolio reconstruction and we’ll be looking forward to see what we can do. So we accept that 2018 was a difficult year and that’s only natural.One of the things that you probably know from my time at EPF is that I’m perfectly happy to be as transparent as possible on financial numbers and results. So, when the time comes at the end of the month, we’ll be as transparent as we can, and in terms of the results, it is what it is. M+S, what is the latest news?As you would have seen from various news reports, M+S is engaging in a process on its Duo assets and that process is ongoing right now, so I’m not really at liberty to talk too much about what’s happening in that process, but effectively if that process concludes, they’ll make the right announcements. Sounds like all possibilities are still relatively open for Malaysia Airlines if they can come up with a plan that convinces Khazanah. But if they continue to struggle, like you said a lot of national carriers are struggling around the world, if they continue to struggle and cannot find the right plan, can or will Khazanah eventually draw a line somewhere?Well, ultimately, I think the right question to ask — and this ultimately is a policy decision that will be made by the government — is how valuable are the intangible benefits that a national airline provides to the country. And to what extent are you willing to keep investing in a company to enjoy those intangible benefits, even the company itself, the airline itself may not enjoy the commercial benefits.Because the reality is that for every dollar of tourist spend or business spend that Malaysia Airlines can bring into the country, that’s a dollar for the country but not necessarily a benefit for the airline itself. So there’s a multiplier of roughly eight to 10 times in terms of spend to the country. The issue for the government, at some point, will be to ask that question. So the government has to decide lah.Yes, ultimately it’s a question that the government has to decide because that affects the commitment of Khazanah towards the airline itself. If we only take one thing away from this interview, what should it be?Essentially, if we execute the [new] strategy correctly, then Khazanah really will become that guardian of the nation’s wealth and would be the guardian in terms of that future growth. And that’s important because I think what the country needs is basically a pool of assets that is focused on long-term growth, because over time, you need that pool of assets to contribute back to the national budget in a way that will help to relieve the pressure on other sources of income.Otherwise the country as a whole, our national budget, is overly dependent on just a few sources of income. You pointed out the Singapore example and that’s correct, you should have more diversification [on the sources of income] on the national budget. How long before Khazanah can play that role?The way I look at the portfolio today, it’s easily about seven to 10 years to fully restructure. But this has always been a long-term goal. Most sovereign wealth funds think about 30 years as their time horizon, and that’s why, like I said, what is the right balance or trade-off between short-term cash requirements versus a long-term generation of growth. I think that’s something that needs to be balanced.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-man-mandate,"2019-05-01 20:09:42"

This is the group’s first loss-making quarter since 3QFY15.Average fuel price in 4QFY18 came in at US$92 per barrel, versus of US$69 a year earlier, AirAsia said in a stock exchange filing yesterday.Operating lease expenses rose due to completion of the group’s sale and leaseback transaction, whereby it sold its aircraft and leased them back.The group posted a net profit of RM372.65 million in the previous year’s corresponding quarter, when revenue came in at RM2.66 billion. Revenue grew 6.2% to RM2.82 billion in 4QFY18, after a 16% increase in total passengers carried.However, the group’s load factor in 4QFY18 fell to 84% from 88% previously, as the increase in total passengers carried was lower than the 21% increase in capacity, as the group sought to increase its market share and secure airport slots.AirAsia said this resulted in a short-term setback as fares were down by 6% to RM171, as it prepares for a strong start in 2019.The group said there were numerous one-off items related to the transfer of aircraft to BBAM Ltd Partnership and change in accounting from owning to leasing of aircraft.“To name a few, those relating to the BBAM transactions include professional fees of RM101 million, re-recognition of RM29 million for depreciation of five unsold aircraft and accretion of RM16 million finance cost tied to the assets sold.“These one-off costs resulted in a net operating loss of RM220.4 million. The total one-off items amounted to RM318 million. Eliminating the amount, the quarter’s performance was commendable and would have recorded RM98 million,” it said.For the full-year period, AirAsia’s net profit rose 21.5% to RM1.98 billion, from RM1.63 billion in the previous year, while revenue rose 9.2% to RM10.6 billion, from RM9.71 billion.“It was a great 2018. We gained a significant market share across the group and recorded a RM1.7 billion in net profit for the full financial year. Financial results were commendable despite the abnormal fuel hike.“We are focused on keeping costs low for all AOCs (air operator’s certificate) and will continue to reduce costs further,” said AirAsia deputy group chief executive officer Bo Lingam in a statement.He said the group is confident that all Asean AOCs will be profitable in 2019, given the strong load trend seen since the start of the year.AirAsia chief executive officer Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said 2019 will be the start of AirAsia’s transformation, pointing out that the group had generated more than RM16 billion in gross merchandise revenue from its online flight ticket sales in 2018.“This platform is in fact one of the largest revenue generating platforms in Asia today. Hence, we are also increasing our efforts to sell additional travel-related services such as hotels, tours, insurance and more to millions of our guests who fly with us.“We intend to transform AirAsia.com into a platform of choice for all to fulfil any travel needs.

As such, Yee is bullish on both the performance and earnings growth of construction stocks this year. He estimated an average 15% to 20% increase in earnings for construction firms and particularly favours IJM Corp Bhd, which is among the biggest contractors on the stock exchange and is expected to be a prime beneficiary of the Penang Transport Master Plan. Yee noted that compared to Gamuda, which had gained some 48.3% year-to-date (YTD), IJM has climbed 40.7%.However, the construction sector is under-represented in the benchmark FBM KLCI, which is what most global fund managers keep their eyes on, he explained.Rakuten projected an earnings growth of 2.4% for the KLCI this year, which is expected to rise to 6.3% in 2020. The lacklustre growth in earnings this year is due to gaming stocks pulled down by additional tax on casinos.The impact of this tax will be felt by Genting Bhd and Genting Malaysia Bhd, said Yee.The research team expects the KLCI to touch 1,760 points by the end of this year based on 16 times forward price-earnings ratio.While the summer holidays for global fund managers are likely to keep the KLCI sluggish in the second quarter of 2019, Yee opined that foreign funds in the local market are already at a minimum after a heavy outflow over 2018 totalling RM11.6 billion and a current YTD foreign selling of RM2.57 billion.He added that a weak ringgit to the US dollar and the pickup in construction and business activity will draw foreign funds back to Malaysia, “hopefully by the third quarter of 2019.”Rakuten continues to favour selected blue-chip stocks, particularly in banking, as they are now under foreign holdings and trading at “reasonable levels”.“It is a good time to accumulate index-linked stocks,” said Yee.He also opined that the selldown of KLCI constituents over the FTSE Russell review of Malaysian bonds and the possible downgrade in sovereign ratings by credit ratings agencies has been overhyped.Other catalysts for funds flowing back into Malaysia and other Asean countries include the Chinese government’s proposal to reduce the reserve requirement ratio for its banking sector, which could see an estimated US$120 billion flowing into the global monetary system for every 1% cut, Rakuten said. Additionally, some US$80 billion of foreign funds is expected to be drawn to China as MSCI will increase the country’s weighting to 20% from 5% in stages this year.“When foreign funds come back [to Malaysia], that will be the start of a bull run,” Yee said, adding that the returning fund flow could lift the ringgit to 3.90 against the US dollar this year.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/revival-megaprojects-shows-govt-more-businessminded,"2019-05-01 20:09:47"

The fund is meant for major building maintenance works such as malfunctioning lifts, water-proofing, upgrades of fire-fighting equipment and other upgrading works.Architect Centre Sdn Bhd accredited architect and trainer Anthony Lee Tee said that some property owners are reluctant to contribute to the sinking fund as they are in denial and refuse to take ownership of the maintenance issues in their building. Some owners may be investors and only hope to reap profits by flipping the property and hence think that they do not need to bother about paying.“We always ask why pay money for the sinking fund when other people don’t? Why should I put in all the money in there when I am going to flip it and move away?"" he asked at a panel discussion themed “What happens when the party stops?!” at EdgeProp.my’s Symposium on Excellent Property Management 2019 today.“But do you know that the property that you are going to buy into [after] you flip may have the same problem (with people not paying their fees)?"" he told the over 550-large audience who attended the event.This will result in a situation where property owners do not have a sufficient sinking fund to repair or replace important equipment such as fire fighting pumps and tanks and thus make the building an unsafe place to live, he said.“If you have no money in the sinking fund, how are you going to replace the important things, such as fire fighting equipment like pumps and fire fighting tanks? That is why a lot of properties don’t have fire certificates,” he added.At the discussion moderated by EdgeProp.my managing director and editor-in-chief Au Foong Yee, panellists Chur Associates founder and managing partner Chris Tan and Singapore’s Association of Property and Facility Managers president Dr. Lim Lan Yuan also emphasised the importance of the sinking fund and the utilisation and management of the fund.“You shouldn’t simply touch the sinking fund as it is reserved for certain things only and should not be used for other purposes,” said Tan.Meanwhile, Lim noted that Singapore also faces the same issue with educating owners about the importance of sinking fund.“In Singapore, we also have the same difficulties. But we are educating the owners to put aside sufficient funds so that in the future, you don’t need to carve out so much when something major in the building needs to be fixed,"" he said.Themed “Is your investment future-proof?” the symposium was organised by EdgeProp.my in collaboration with partner Nippon Paint Malaysia and supporting sponsors Gamuda Land and Panasonic Malaysia.

Accordingly, the developer must pay the maintenance charge to the JMB for the second and third year, after having lapsed the developer’s management period of the first year,” said Chang.He said the developer is presumably able to honour offers such as free maintenance charges because of factors such as no big capital expenses during the first few years since it’s a new building and only minimum expenses are incurred such as paying the salaries of only a few management staff.“Thus, it is not wrong or misleading for the developer’s creativity in offering to pay the maintenance charges in the first year (developer’s managing period) but in the second and third year, it becomes apparently difficult when the JMB takes over the management control. The JMB is an entirely new set up, whether the fellow owners run it or they employ licensed property managers. Can they sustain?” Chang questioned.He said that the developer will only cover the expenses of maintenance of common property during the Defects and Liabilities Period (DLP) where the major mechanical and electrical facilities are under free maintenance warranty by their manufacturer.“In-fact, upon the JMB being formed on the second and third year, the developer has to pay the actual rate of Charges as stated in Schedule 5 of the Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) or the operating budget that is issued by the JMB,” Chang added.The half-day symposium was organised by EdgeProp.my with partners Nippon Paint Malaysia.

The RM588 million, strata-titled Luxura is the second phase of twentyfive.7, a 257-acre township in Telok Panglima Garang, Selangor. Occupying 36.52 acres of leasehold land, it will have 315 units of 2 and 3-storey link villas.According to twentyfive.7 general manager Chu Wai Lune, the gated and guarded community will be divided into three sub-phases. The first comprises 100 units, with the remaining two sub-phases to be launched at a later date.“We originally planned to launch Luxura in 2021 but because of strong demand, we decided to bring it forward,” he says.There will be five house types with two layouts — 4+1 bedrooms with 4 bathrooms and 5+1 bedrooms with 5 bathrooms. Land areas are 26ft x 70ft and 28ft x 70ft with built-ups from 2,605 to 3,466 sq ft. Selling prices start from RM1.2 million.Chu says Luxura is an improved version of Lucent Residences, the township’s first phase of landed homes.“The first improvement is the kitchen. All units in Luxura will have a double loading kitchen, meaning there will be kitchen cabinets on both sides,” he says. “And we have made the ground floor toilet more elderly friendly. It will be large enough to accommodate a wheelchair and there will be a ramp for easy access. In addition there will be a support bar, panic button and a foldable seat in the shower area.”There will be a ramp in the car porch to allow wheelchair-bound people to easily access the main door. All units will come with a solar water heater, home alarm system, water filter and air conditioning.Luxura will offer 30 Hero products and the selling price will start from RM1.8 million. Chu says Hero products are limited units that will have a few unique features. One will be the signature multi-façade rows, where each house will have a different look. “Usually, when you look at a row of houses, the façades are the same but Hero products will have different ones.”In addition, purchasers will be able to customise the interiors. “The laminated floor patterns, the colours … we will allow buyers the option of customisation.”The developer plans to create a mobile application where purchasers can see a 3D version of the house and pick and choose their options. “It is better that they choose now and we build it for them rather than they come back later and hack and do their own renovations,” Chu says.Luxura will have 16 units with triple-volume ceilings. “We call this the light house because the design allows 75% of natural lighting to enter the house. These units will be launched later,” he says. Updates on twentyfive.7Located south of Gamuda’s award-winning township, Kota Kemuning, the RM4.2 billion twentyfive.7 was launched in 2017.Lucent Residences, Phase 1, comprises 181 superlink homes and 98 semi-detached houses. It is currently 80% sold and will be completed the middle of next year.The Amber Residence, the township’s first high-rise development, comprises 596 serviced apartments and 32 retail shops. Launched last year, it is 40% sold and is slated to be completed in 2021.Chu says the developer’s main priority is the community, and this is why Gamuda decided to build Quayside Mall with key tenants that include MBO cinemas, Jaya Grocer and Mr DIY. “Residents do not have to leave the township to shop. They can just go to the mall nearby.”The 504,539 sq ft mall, which will be managed Gamuda, will have a net lettable area of 328,153 sq ft (excluding kiosks) and will comprise 107 retail lots and 19 kiosks. It will be completed the middle of next year, around the same time as Lucent Residences.About 50% of the retail space has been taken up and Chu hopes that the time it opens its doors it will be 75%.The developer has also created a place-making space called Buzz.ar, which is already open. The pet-friendly Buzz.ar is next to the lake and has a 600m loop for jogging or cycling. People can bring their pets and have a stroll. Waste disposal bags are available.There are four shops, three of which are tenanted — Heritage Nyonya Cuisine Restaurant, Marc et Farid Patisserie and pet care centre FURIIstyle. The developer will retain the remaining unit to host community events, says Chu. He plans to put in a ping pong table for residents to use for free. An open space offers picnic tables and chairs and fairy lights will be strung soon. Opposite will be the Moonlight Cinema, an outdoor movie theatre where live football matches as well as movies  will be screened, Chu says.And the children have not been forgotten. A splash pad with ground nozzles will be installed soon in the play area, which features a games corner, which has giant Jenga and a giant chess board.Next month, Gamuda is installing Aurora Rhythms, a musical water fountain, at the lake.

671,"April 23, 2019 08:33 am +08",GAMUDA,"Bandar Malaysia, ECRL revivals boost construction stocks, wider market","KUALA LUMPUR: Bursa Malaysia’s Construction Index bucked the sluggish benchmark index to climb 8.15% or 16.52 points to reach an eight-month high of 219.20 points yesterday, the first trading day after the government announced last Friday that the Bandar Malaysia project would be reinstated.The announcement came exactly a week after the government said on April 12 it would continue with the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), at a lower cost of RM44 billion compared with its original cost of RM65.5 billion.Leading the surge in the sector was Ekovest Bhd, which is linked to Bandar Malaysia’s master developer, IWH-CREC Sdn Bhd, via common shareholder Tan Sri Lim Kang Hoo.Ekovest shares shot up to a one-year high of 97 sen after climbing 30 sen or 44.78% to hit limit up yesterday. It was Bursa’s most actively traded counter of the day, with 282.03 million shares done.  Its share price has more than doubled year to date.Also active in line with the Bandar Malaysia theme was Iskandar Waterfront City Bhd (IWCity), which is also controlled by Lim and a subsidiary of IWH. Shares in the developer rose 30 sen or 29.41% to RM1.32, having tripled since the start of the year.Other notable gainers were Gadang Holdings Bhd, which rose 23 sen or 32.17%, and Fajarbaru Builder Group Bhd, which climbed 11 sen or 27.16% (see table). Out of 49 stocks on the Kuala Lumpur Construction Index, 40 closed higher yesterday, while only two ended the day in the red.Other big names in the construction sector that closed higher include Gamuda Bhd (up 27 sen or 8.77% to RM3.35), IJM Corp Bhd (up nine sen or 4.09% to RM2.29) and Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (up 10 sen or 10.42% to RM1.06).According to Rakuten Trade head of research Kenny Yee, the rally in construction stocks is not just because of the revival of Bandar Malaysia. “Bandar Malaysia does play a part but most importantly, it is the positive newsflow on projects of late that has propped up the construction sector,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.Although the ECRL is now going to be cheaper by 32.8% or RM21.5 billion, the project’s main contractor China Communications Construction Co Ltd has agreed — under the new supplementary agreement signed with Putrajaya on April 12 — to ensure 40% of the civil works are awarded to local contractors.While the twin revivals of the ECRL and Bandar Malaysia have given a shot in the arm to construction stocks, they do not seem to have generated strong buying interest among constituents of the benchmark FBM KLCI, which closed flattish yesterday.Nevertheless, they appear to have acted as a catalyst for the wider market, as market breadth was positive across Bursa Malaysia yesterday, with 544 gainers outpacing 326 decliners. Trading volume swelled to 4.77 billion shares, with a significant RM3.18 billion value of shares crossed.Interestingly, PLS Plantations Bhd, another company which Lim controls, also climbed. The loss-making oil palm planter, which is diversifying into the durian plantation business, jumped 28 sen or 29.23% yesterday to close at RM1.26.Other gainers included building materials players like cement maker Lafarge Malaysia Bhd, which gained 13.3% to close at RM2.64. The stock saw only tepid interest last week despite news of the ECRL’s continuation, as analysts opined that the railway alone would add only a small boost to demand for its products. Meanwhile, steelmakers like Ann Joo Resources Bhd, Mycron Steel Bhd, Malaysia Steel Works (KL) Bhd and Southern Steel Bhd also gained.According to AmInvestment Bank’s research team yesterday, demand for building materials will depend on how aggressively Bandar Malaysia rolls out its launches.“We are more inclined to want to look beyond the sectors in our analysis for the revival of Bandar Malaysia. We believe investors should instead focus on how the improved Malaysia-China ties could help bring down the market risk premium, resulting in multiple expansion for the market,” it said in a note.“We are mindful that not many local contractors have worked with Chinese main contractors before, and if their experience in time will be a fruitful one,” AmInvestment Bank said.As to whether the rejuvenation of the mega infrastructure project signals a potential comeback of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), where the last agreed alignment included a stop at Bandar Malaysia, views were mixed.While AllianceDBS is positive on the HSR’s resuscitation, CIMB Research does not think Bandar Malaysia’s reinstatement suggests a similar fate for the HSR, which is still pending a review, with a decision due on May 2020.“While the return of Bandar Malaysia is a positive surprise in terms of potentially catalysing new construction works, potential beneficiaries are likely limited to smaller/medium-sized building contractors for which tenders could be competitive,” CIMB Research added in a note yesterday.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bandar-malaysia-ecrl-revivals-boost-construction-stocks-wider-market,"2019-05-01 20:09:53"

Upgrade to hold with a revised target price (TP) of RM3.22. The National Physical Planning Council (NPPC) has approved the reclamation of three islands (Penang South Reclamation Scheme) south of Penang Island. The project was approved with 18 conditions. 
The three islands will have a combined area of 17 sq km, comprising Island A (9.3 sq km), Island B (4.45 sq km) and Island C (3.23 sq km).The reclaimed land, which will belong to the Penang government, will be auctioned off to finance the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP). It is estimated that the land bank is expected to generate more than RM70 billion for Penang to fund the PTMP and economic development in the state.Separately, another component of the PTMP — Pan Island Link 1 (PIL1) — was approved last week by the Department of Environment with 56 conditions. The construction of PIL1 is targeted to start by the middle of 2020.Meanwhile, the Komtar-Bayan Lepas light rail transit (LRT) line is awaiting conditional approval by the transport ministry and is likely to be obtained soon. The construction of the LRT line is expected to start next year.Another hurdle to be cleared to get the project off the ground is sourcing of a bridging loan. As it requires time to reclaim the land and get it ready to be monetised, a bridging loan is required to kick-start the PIL1 and the LRT line.We understand that both the Project Delivery Partner — SRS Consortium, in which Gamuda has a 60% stake — and the state government will come out with their own portions of the funding. This is to enable both the PIL1 and the LRT line to start concurrently.Gamuda is expected to receive the first tranche payment of RM760 million soon, from the disposal of water concession Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor Sdn Bhd (Splash), with the remaining RM260 million to be paid in instalments over nine years. We believe the bulk of the sale proceeds would be reserved to fund the PTMP project.

680,"April 17, 2019 18:00 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Dhaya Maju LTAT submits new proposal for KVDT2 ","DHAYA Maju LTAT Sdn Bhd, a joint venture between privately held Dhaya Maju Infrastructure (Asia) Sdn Bhd (DMIA) and Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT), has submitted a new proposal to the government in a bid to win back the Klang Valley Double Track Phase 2 (KVDT2) contract.Dhaya Maju LTAT director Datuk Seri Subramaniam Pillai says the company recently returned to the negotiation table with the government to work out a new agreement.“We have held discussions with various parties involved in the KVDT2 project, including the Ministry of Transport (MoT). We have given our proposal to the government, taking into account the present situation,” he tells The Edge in an interview.The proposal provides two options, but Subramaniam, who is also executive director of DMIA, declines to elaborate. “We leave it to the government to make a decision on our latest submission,” he says.The KVDT2 entails the rehabilitation of two KTM Bhd railway tracks — one from Salak South to Seremban and the other track from a point between Kuala Lumpur Sentral and Angkasa Puri to Port Klang — measuring a total of 211km.The previous Barisan Nasional (BN) government had awarded the contract to Dhaya Maju LTAT on April 4 last year, valued at RM5.265 billion. However, the contract was terminated by the new Pakatan Harapan government in September due to its high cost and the manner in which it was awarded via direct negotiation. Transport Minister Anthony Loke was also reported to have said that the seven-year completion period given to the company was too long.Subramaniam clarifies that under the earlier proposal put forth to the BN government, Dhaya Maju LTAT had offered to complete the project within five years.However, due to budgetary constraints, the BN government had opted for seven years and in recent negotiations, the company had informed the current government that it can complete the job in five years, provided it gets stakeholders’ support.A letter dated Feb 21, signed by KTMB CEO Mohd Rani Hisham Samsudin and addressed to Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng, expresses the national railway company’s unhappiness with DMIA’s performance in undertaking Phase 1 of the KVDT project (KVDT1) worth RM1.41 billion. It claims that it had resulted in the disruption of its train operations and a decline in passenger volume. Loke is copied on the letter.The KVDT1 project involves the rehabilitation of a 40km stretch from Rawang to Salak South. DMIA is undertaking this project, which is 75% completed, on its own.The letter, sighted by The Edge, highlights KTMB’s dissatisfaction with DMIA’s lack of competent staff, weakness in the scheduling of its work plans and insufficient construction equipment such as earth poles while certain materials such as rail and point machines had failed to meet the standards specified in the contract.KTMB went on to say that due to these factors, it would be improper for the government to consider Dhaya Maju LTAT’s participation in the KDVT2. The letter then named India’s IRCON International Ltd, MMC Gamuda JV Sdn Bhd, IJM Construction Sdn Bhd and Emrail Sdn Bhd for consideration when appointing the contractor for KVDT2.To this, DMIA chief operating officer Datuk Mohamed Razeek Md Hussain Maricar acknowledges that KVDT1’s original 2019 completion date was moved to July 2020 because of restrictions in accessing the work sites, which delayed its work.“One of the misperceptions is that Phase 1 is facing delays. But the fact that we have been given an extension of time by our client (MoT) testifies that the delays were beyond our control. We will try to complete the job by July 2020,” he says.Asked whether DMIA has resolved its differences with KTMB, Mohamed Razeek says, “We regard ourselves as a collaborative partner of KTMB. We cannot do this on our own without KTMB’s support and we need its support. Where and when we work has to be in compliance with KTMB’s [train] operations. We believe that misperception has been clarified and resolved.”Subramaniam also says unlike previous electrified double-track rail projects like those of Ipoh-Padang Besar and Gemas-Johor Baru, which are greenfield projects, the KVDT2 is a brownfield project and costs more.“The Klang Valley rail tracks are 25 years old. You need to replace the entire track with new higher grade rails and ballast, carry out soil treatment and improve the drainage to ensure a safe and smooth train ride. To say that you only need to treat the problem areas and that the reduced-to-necessity scope will result in savings is completely misleading,” he adds.Subramaniam also points out that Dhaya Maju LTAT’s RM5.265 billion cost for KVDT2 is based on the 2007 price benchmark of the Ipoh-Padang Besar double-track project.“We firmly believe, based on current rates, the cost would be above RM7 billion if the government calls for a fresh tender,” he says.He adds that RM280 million has been spent on equipment, including an S2PV track laying system — the only one in Southeast Asia — which has only partially been impaired.Companies Commission of Malaysia data shows that Subramaniam holds a 30% stake in DMIA; director Siti Saffur Mansor, 35.83%; director Nazreen Ahmad, 26.67%; and Abdullah Abdul Rahman, 7.5%. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/dhaya-maju-ltat-submits-new-proposal-kvdt2,"2019-05-01 20:09:59"
681,"April 17, 2019 16:00 pm +08",GAMUDA,"K-One looking to the cloud for a pot of gold ","AFTER a turnaround last year, ACE Market-listed box-build manufacturer K-One Technology Bhd is banking on its newly-acquired cloud computing business to shore up its financial performance.According to K-One executive chairman and co-founder Edwin Lim Beng Fook, the global window of opportunity for cloud computing services may be closing within the next three years, but there is still immense opportunity in Southeast Asia.As such, it is important for G-AsiaPacific Sdn Bhd — the cloud computing arm of K-One — to establish itself and gain a foothold in the Asean market, which is a laggard in the sector compared with the US, Europe, Japan, South Korea and China, he tells The Edge in an interview. “Although G-AsiaPacific is already the market leader in Malaysia, our next target is to venture abroad. We have to grab as much low-hanging fruit as we can within a short period of time.”Starting this year, G-AsiaPacific will venture into Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, followed by Singapore in its second phase of expansion. Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia could come after.“We have to spread our arms all over the Asean region. We want to give our potential competitors a run for their money. This game is about who gets there first to garner the market share,” says Lim, 61, who co-founded K-One in 2001.Last month, K-One completed the acquisition of a 60% stake in G-AsiaPacific for RM20.4 million cash. As a whole, the company is valued at RM34 million, representing eight times its annual profit guarantee of RM4.25 million.G-AsiaPacific is a fully integrated cloud advisory and brokerage firm founded by three technopreneurs — Goh Kiang Kiat, Goh Kiang Kian and Chen Kak Toong — in 2008.Lim acknowledges the trio could still grow G-AsiaPacific on their own but, by combining forces, K-One could take the company to the next level within a shorter time.“They were introduced to me by friends almost a year ago. I came to learn that they have done pretty well over the last 10 years, growing from a smallish firm to a medium-sized tech company today. They hope to take the company to greater heights, so we decided to do this.”Interestingly, K-One intends to acquire the remaining 40% of AsiaPacific as early as the second or third quarter of next year, through the issuance of K-One shares to the three founders.In the financial year ended Feb 28, 2018 (FY2018), G-AsiaPacific generated a profit of about RM4 million on revenue of RM17.5 million. Lim says the company has been profitable all along, but has only grown to a respectable size in recent years.“Today, everybody is jumping into the cloud computing space, including Alibaba and Tencent. Then there are Apple and IBM. Some of these companies are expecting cloud services to make the most money for them in the coming years. It is a very important space,” he says. Three main principalsAt the moment, G-AsiaPacific has three principals — Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft. When the time is right, the company aims to take on additional principals.“We are always exploring, we never close our doors. We might secure one or two new principals in the next two years,” says Lim.For perspective, G-AsiaPacific is a distributor for Amazon, Google and Microsoft. The company does not own any physical data and data centres. It helps the clients of the principals manage and migrate their data to the cloud, hosted by Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which own the data centres.“Most of the time, companies have their own in-house servers and back-up servers. But as they grow bigger, rather than storing the data in their own servers, they might as well put it up on the cloud,” says Lim.As for the principals, he says that their capital expenditure and working capital should reduce as they do not have to hire so many employees around the world. “Their preferred business model is to work with partners like us. We hire the technical staff, who will be trained by the principals, and our people do the migration and maintenance on their behalf. We even knock on doors and sign up clients for them.”Currently, G-AsiaPacific has over 3,000 customers in Malaysia, including AirAsia Bhd, Gamuda Land, IJM Corp, Malindo Air, Padini, Royal Selangor, Starbucks and Shiseido.“I believe Malaysians have started to realise the benefits of technology and the cloud, how it can help them to save costs,” says Lim.Following two consecutive years of losses, K-One returned to the black in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018), with a net profit of RM5.6 million on revenue of RM73 million.With G-AsiaPacific’s profit guarantee, Lim expects K-One, which has a market capitalisation of RM174.9 million,  to register strong double-digit revenue and profit growth for the next two years at the very least. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/kone-looking-cloud-pot-gold,"2019-05-01 20:09:59"

685,"April 16, 2019 12:17 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Designing a home for all Malaysians","Over the years, demand for homes has grown, along with affordability concerns. With the aim of being part of the conversation and ultimately helping to alleviate the situation, Persatuan Akitek Malaysia (PAM) and Gamuda Industrial Building Systems Sdn Bhd (Gamuda IBS) have teamed up to organise a design competition called Housing 4.0.The competition is open to PAM members, who can also form teams that include non-members. The competition starts on April 16 (refer to sidebar for full details). Participants will use Building Information Modelling (BIM) to design an entire high-rise development within an urban setting that will contain individual units, commercial components and amenities. A detailed competition brief will be given to each participant or team.Housing 4.0 is headed by architect and PAM council member Ang Chee Cheong and Gamuda IBS general manager Tan Ek Khai. They say the design competition is aimed at exposing the construction industry and designers to the benefits of using BIM and the digital Industrialised Building System (IBS) ecosystem. Ang says the collaboration came about because they saw a lack of discussion between the government and property developers with architects and end users.“We thought this would be a good opportunity for PAM to tie up with a leading technology player (Gamuda IBS) and see what we can develop to address the national housing issue,” says Ang.Tan explains that Gamuda IBS has been in business for only three years but has developed a digital IBS ecosystem that it is ready to share with others. “Architects are what we call the brains of the building; we [Gamuda IBS] are the limbs and panels that form the structure of the building. We bring [to the table] technology and building solutions as well as our experience as the nation’s top contractor and property developer,” says Tan.The men believe that by providing exposure and support to the industry, more conversations can be held and positive changes can be made.“Digital IBS has not been fully exploited and harnessed yet,” explains Ang. “We are using this collaboration to introduce digital IBS to our members and guide them with a project that develops different housing options. I think this is quite exciting and we are looking forward to the outcome [of the contest].”Tan says while the industry might be aware of new technology, there is no integration between the design and the actual product, simply because the technology is not seen through from beginning to end. However, with the use of BIM and digital IBS, this can be realised. Another advantage is the reduction of foreign labour.“But all of this starts with the design and the design starts with the architect,” Ang says. “So we hope we will be able to help people understand and have a wider acceptance of the use of BIM and digital IBS.”Beyond the competitionAccording to Ang and Tan, the design is for a mass housing residential project that can be easily replicated. While most architects would rather design an iconic building, Ang believes this mindset needs to be changed. “I think mass housing has a stigma to it and we’re determined to break that. We think a house should be sexy. It should be luxurious. I mean, it doesn’t have to have Italian marble but it should be spacious, full of light and have good ventilation. And everything should be well thought through and have good facilities. That is why we call it luxury housing for the masses at an affordable price,” Ang says.The competition provides a platform for both experienced and inexperienced proponents of property development to engage with each other.The teams may comprise people with different expertise. So companies or firms can participate with students. Those studying architecture, engineering or interior design could form a team. “The contest is open to people who have an interest in housing,” says Ang. “The team leader has to be a PAM member. We encourage cross-disciplinary approaches. The teams should have builders, costing guys, engineers, maybe artists and so on. That will enable them to come up with a better product.”But more than that, he believes the submissions will generate discussion on how houses should be designed and what should be in a housing estate or neighbourhood.Another component of the House 4.0 competition is innovation workshops that will allow participants to discuss BIM, digital IBS and tour Gamuda IBS’ factory. This is to expose more people to the benefits and advantages of using IBS.While the winning design may not be built, it is hoped that industry players will be interested to see what IBS can do to help the government meet its “annual 100,000 house target” in the next 10 years.“As for PAM, we are trying to encourage our members to adopt more digital disruption and to have a more modern practice,” says Ang. “We see that we [PAM and Gamuda IBS] are working in many of the same areas. Gamuda IBS also has a BIM academy like us, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to look for areas in which we can collaborate.“I think there are many areas that we are aligned on. I think there will be a tighter collaboration to spearhead a digital partnership because it will give us mutual benefits. We get to assist each other to achieve our goals and objectives,” he says.“For a start, we’d like to see how this collaboration goes and how it is propagated. If there is interest, then obviously, we would like to do more,” says Tan. “And we also are very engaged with industry players. This is a platform where views can be exchanged. Improvements can then be made to the nation’s property sector in many ways.” H.OUSING

The railway will now be 648km — 40km shorter than previously — and pass through Jelebu, Negeri Sembilan, instead of Gombak in the Klang Valley.CIMB Research, however, maintains its “underweight” rating on the construction sector pending more details on the EPCC terms and tender portions for local contractors, which may form upside risks for local players.“Under our coverage, potential beneficiaries include IJM Corp Bhd, Sunway Bhd (via Sunway Construction Group Bhd) and WCT Holdings Bhd,” said CIMB research.IJM Corp closed two sen or 0.88% lower to RM2.25, while Sunway Construction rose three sen or 1.55% to RM1.96. WCT also closed higher by 0.5 sen or 0.52% to 96.5 sen.Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd senior analyst Kenneth Leong concurred that most contractors have likely already reacted to the news beforehand. Any fresh catalysts for buy-in would be updated on the terms for local contractors, he said.“Stocks to look at would be IJM Corp as it has experience in road and rail projects. Gamuda Bhd and Gadang Holdings are also contenders,” he told The Edge Financial Daily when contacted.Gamuda closed six sen or 1.88% lower to RM3.13, while Gadang lost 2.5 sen or 3.52% to settle at 68.5 sen.Shares of building material stocks such as Lafarge Malaysia Bhd and Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd, which are also said to be contenders to benefit from the ECRL project had traded in positive territory early yesterday before paring gains at market close.Lafarge Malaysia closed three sen lower or 1.21% to RM2.45, while Press Metal closed unchanged at RM4.53. Ann Joo Resources Bhd also ended eight sen or 4.47% lower to RM1.71.In a research note yesterday, AllianceDBS noted that the revival of the ECRL project is a small win as it is likely that CCCC would also revive the cement supply contract (worth RM270mil then) signed with Lafarge in 2016. The contract was cancelled last year following the suspension of the project.“We estimate if the RM270 million contract remains, this will translate into [about] 1.2 million tonnes of cement demand – spread over the next four years, equivalent to 300,000 tonnes per year. This is relatively small compared to Lafarge’s effective capacity of 8.2 million tonnes. As such, we think that more infrastructure projects are needed to support demand,” said AllianceDBS.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/revival-ecrl-catalyst-market-already-priced-positive-news,"2019-05-01 20:10:01"

This means investors should be looking for stocks that have good growth prospects or strong fundamentals.“If the [share] price is attractive and [the company’s] growth [prospects] are good, then it will serve as a buying opportunity,” he added.The FBM KLCI fell to a fresh two-year low last Thursday, closing at 1,624.23 points, as heightened concerns over slower global economic growth prompted investors to seek refuge in safe havens. The benchmark index inched up 5.94 points or 0.37% to close at 1,630.17 last Friday.Last week’s downward revision of the 2019 global growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund to 3.3% from 3.5% did not help matters. The fund had earlier this year revised down its growth forecast from 3.6%.Nomura head of equity research for Malaysia Tushar Mohata agrees that now is not the right time to turn to defensive stocks.That is because the defensive stocks on Bursa Malaysia have underperformed their Asean counterparts “significantly” due to strong outflows from foreign portfolio investors, he said.According to last Monday’s fund flow report by MIDF Research, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, foreign funds have sold RM1.76 billion net of local equities. Among the four Asean markets (Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines) it monitors, Malaysia has now surpassed Thailand to become the nation with the largest foreign net outflow.“Investors may want to consider looking at high beta stocks, which are trading at steep discount to their long-term average trading multiples. The near-term catalysts of these stocks could be improving earnings momentum,” said Tushar.He believes that these high beta stocks are likely to rally when Bursa reverses course and outperforms its peers in Asean.His top picks are CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd.For investors who want exposure to defensive sectors, Tushar pointed out that real estate investment trusts (REITs) are one due to their stable yield.RHB Research Institute head of Malaysian research Alexander Chia said for domestic investors that need to remain invested in local equities, the preservation of capital will be a key priority.“Adding some defensive names to one’s portfolio continues to make tactical sense, given the prevailing risks that are still unfolding. These companies should have strong earnings resilience that can ride through market upheavals,” he added.Chia is recommending stocks such as Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Mynews Holdings Bhd, Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd and QL Resources Bhd.However, in the short term, Chia said investors should be aware of the persistent selling by foreign portfolio investors and hence, be wary of stocks with large foreign shareholdings.He also noted that only large-cap stocks have underperformed this year, while small-cap stocks have performed well.YTD, the FBM Small Cap Index has risen 18.29% to close at 13,365.62 points last Friday, while the KLCI has fallen 3.57%.Noting that it is a trading market now, Chia said funds need to make money and achieve alpha or active returns on their investments.“The market is now very short-term and the valuation [of Malaysian stocks] is not that cheap even at current levels,” he added.Hence, he opined that investors should look for pockets of opportunity, beaten down stocks, value buys and undervalued stocks. Silver lining in defensive stocksWhile current market conditions have not been really positive and it is seen that even defensive stocks have been underperforming so far this year, analysts still see some silver lining in defensive stocks.UOB Kay Hian Malaysia research head Vincent Khoo expects defensive stocks to underperform the broader market in the near term, as the government steps up fiscal stimulus activities via megaprojects.This is also to respect the sanctity of government contracts, especially pertaining to its proposed acquisition of Gamuda’s highways, he said.“In such a scenario, we foresee improved investor confidence and foreign equity flows turning positive,” he added.However, there are still some defensive stocks which continue to have modest appeal and these include high dividend yielders such as IGB REIT and Magnum Bhd.Khoo said stocks that will continue to remain attractive include selective beneficiaries of megaprojects and trade diversion.Meanwhile, stocks to avoid include selective glove manufacturers as clarity on demand and supply dynamics is needed; selective technology companies on the back of anticipated weak first quarter of 2019 results season; and Telekom Malaysia Bhd where UOB Kay Hian will need to assess the magnitude of its fall in broadband access average revenue per user.MIDF Research head Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman is of the view that defensive stocks can still be a safe haven when it comes to consumer consumption and dividend play.In relation to consumption, he noted that the distributive trade was still growing at 6.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) in February, albeit moderating from 7.8% y-o-y in the previous month, due to a shorter month and the festive holidays.Retail growth was 8.5% y-o-y, while wholesale and motor vehicles grew 5.8% y-o-y and 2.4% y-o-y respectively.“This shows consumption remains strong among Malaysians,” said Redza.He said stocks with “still strong earnings”, coupled with stable dividend payments, should also be considered amid these trying times.“Companies with strong earnings would provide a stable flow of future dividends and with market sentiment negatively affecting the price movements, this could present a good opportunity to accumulate stocks with high dividend yields.“So, investors shouldn’t just look at historical dividend payments alone; they also have to look at the defensiveness of the companies’ profits,” he added.MIDF Research is recommending stocks such as DiGi.Com Bhd, MBM Resources Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and UOA Development Bhd.Despite concerns over a potential cut in the overnight policy rate by Bank Negara Malaysia, which may negatively impact banks’ profitability, Redza also likes CIMB and Malayan Banking Bhd, noting that their share prices have fallen a lot over the past year.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/when-defensive-stocks-are-no-longer-bearmarket-safe-haven,"2019-05-01 20:10:01"
688,"April 13, 2019 15:00 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Rehda Youth’s tour of Gamuda IBS Sepang","On a hot and sunny Tuesday morning, 39 participants from Rehda Youth walked into the foyer of the Gamuda IBS Sepang factory. Their visit was to learn about the benefits and practical aspects of the Industrialised Building System (IBS) — which involves manufacturing building components in a factory, for example, and then transporting them to a construction site for assembly.According to organising chairman and Rehda Youth secretary Ng Choon Keith, “IBS has been in Malaysia for 10 to 15 years, and for Gamuda to pioneer this factory is commendable. Many systems are being designed and engineered, but no developer has really embraced IBS like Gamuda.“For us to come visit [the factory] is to educate our members and also give them an opportunity to look around. That is one of the incentives of being a Rehda Youth member.”Gamuda built its first automated and robotics IBS factory in Sepang in 2016According to Gamuda Industrial Building System Sdn Bhd general manager Tan Ek Khai, digital IBS will take the construction industry to a new level.“The next phase of growth for construction is in this sector, where digital design tools such as building information modelling (BIM), coupled with robotics construction, will drive the industry in a vertically integrated value chain.“In line with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Gamuda IBS is able to elevate and prepare the workforce of the future for a construction industry that leverages on technology. The shifting of on-site construction to off-site manufacturing is a key strategy to attract the young Malaysian workforce to the industry,” says TanGamuda IBS Sepang sits on 27 acres of land. It was followed by a 66-acre factory in Banting that was completed in end-2018. Both factories combined will generate a total capacity of 10,000 units and 16,000 bathroom pods annually.“Gamuda IBS has already delivered 2,000 affordable homes for Gamuda Land, and it is bound to deliver another 3,000 units for Worldwide Holdings Bhd and the Selangor State Development Corporation among others,” says Tan. “The IBS factory will also be used to build high-end landed and high-rise homes in Gamuda Land’s new townships.” The high-rise project is called AmberResidences at twentyfive.7 in Kota Kemuning with 500 units while the landed properties will be in Gamuda Cove in southern Klang Valley with 490 units.A briefing on the benefits of using the digital IBS system was held before the tour commenced. It explained the shared digital ecosystem where the product design is done via BIM, and the information is then distributed to robots in the factory to manufacture the components needed. The process then follows with labelled components being delivered to the construction site and, like Lego, put together for the final product.It is a time-saving construction method. According to Gamuda, the system allows for three projects to be completed compared with two projects using conventional methods and time frame. This system also mitigates delays and reduces the need for foreign labour while ensuring that quality is maintained throughout the construction process. Moreover, it creates less wastage, increases safety and keeps the construction site clean and uncluttered.One of the participants asked about the cost of manufacturing, to which the response was that it costs about 6% more to produce, however, because a building can be erected faster, the cost saved in time will even out eventually. The factory tourAfter the briefing, participants were given reflective vests and purple hard hats — Gamuda’s official dress code for visitors to the factory. The purple colour serves to signify that visitors are given priority in case of an emergency.Rehda Youth’s first stop on the tour was a factory station dedicated to the creation of moulds into which concrete is poured to create the wall panels. Here, a robot picks up bars, or shutters as they are called, and places them on a large stainless steel plate. The shutters are magnetised to the plate and sections that are not blocked by the shutters will be done manually with polystyrene blocks. The plate then moves on to different stations where machines and labourers work together to produce smooth wall panels, which once ready are then sent to the construction site to be assembled.What stood out was how clean the factory floors were and also how systematic everything looked. There was a section where the wall panels were smoothed by a fan-like contraption, and we were told that once the walls are installed, a skim coat is applied before painting. Hence, there is no need for plastering.The factory also manufactures bathroom pods with pre-installed fittings, which are plug-and-play worthy once the pods are delivered to the construction site.After the factory tour, participants then visited the show units — a 1-storey bare unit and a 2-storey furnished house — and realised that the product was visually identical to those built conventionally. To the question about renovation, that would have been taken into account from the design stage, and any repairs, say for electrical wiring, can be done as notches and pipes have been installed to allow for wires to be pulled through without any hacking. Proving it worksGamuda has been using the IBS system for most of its own projects although the factories can be engaged by external clients. One such project is the RM125 million Rumah Selangorku (RSKU) Pangaspuri Gapura Bayu in Jade Hills, Kajang that was structurally completed within 12 months. It offers 714 units with built-ups of 650 or 1,100 sq ft across three towers. Another RSKU project is Idaman Residensi in Cyberjaya, where panels are being installed at the moment and should be completed by July this year. Upon completion, the two towers will comprise 864 units of about 1,000 sq ft each.Other Gamuda projects include one in Kundang, Selangor, where the installation took five months and features a single tower with 230 units with built-ups of 750 to 1,000 sq ft.To install the panels, Gamuda will provide labourers to ensure that it is done correctly. However, the company has also trained subcontractors to do the fitting properly.It is hoped that over time, with economies of scale, the cost of manufacturing will reduce and it will be common practice in Malaysia to use IBS.As the tour concluded, several participants shared their takeaways from this learning experience.“I am very glad that there is a developer and contractor that is taking the initiative to bring the construction industry to a new level,” says one.Another believes that “IBS will bring a new era to the industry. I believe that it will bring a lot of benefit, especially on workmanship and time-saving”.One commented that, “This is an eye opener for me … Everything is so systematic and well organised. This is a very good step for our country to reduce the need for foreign labour and move forward to a better construction industry in terms of speed and quality.”",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/rehda-youths-tour-gamuda-ibs-sepang,"2019-05-01 20:10:02"

(April 10, RM1.20)
Maintain neutral on an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.15. According to news reports, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamed indicated that Malaysia was exploring proposals to reduce the cost of the high-speed rail (HSR) project, which could mean a potential revival of the project. 
YTL was previously appointed as one of two project delivery partners (PDP) for the now deferred Kuala Lumpur to Singapore HSR project. YTL submitted a bid for the role via a 70:30 joint venture (JV) with TH Properties (THP). The other consortium appointed for the PDP role previously was MRCB-Gamuda (50:50). The YTL-THP JV was selected for the southern portion of the alignment (Johor portion) and MRCB-Gamuda for the northern portion (KL to state border of Melaka-Johor). Moreover, previously reported contenders for the now deferred HSR project were Gamuda, IJM and Naza’s respective consortiums.YTL is backed by a solid track record given its involvement in the construction and operation of the RM2.4 billion Express Rail Link project which was also one of the cheapest that has been rolled out nearly two decades ago at just RM42 million per km.YTL’s order book is estimated at approximately RM8 billion comprising mainly the Gemas-Johor Baru double-tracking project which was not impacted by the Pakatan Harapan government’s review of infrastructure projects in the past eight months. The construction of YTL Power’s Tanjung Jati coal-powered plant in Indonesia was supposed to add an estimated RM4 billion, but progress on the financial close of this project has been delayed, presumably given the upcoming Indonesian elections.A potential revival of the HSR project is a catalyst for YTL’s construction division (construction currently accounts for 3% of group pretax earnings), while construction earnings has seen progressive improvement in recent quarters given progress in the Gemas-JB double tracking project. A drag however, comes from weak Power Seraya performance given the continued overcapacity situation in Singapore power generation. Hyflux’ woes could be a blessing in disguise as it could mean the elimination of excess capacity should there be a dismantling of gas supply agreements to Hyflux’ plants as part of its restructuring, if any. Other than Singapore power, there continues to be concerns surrounding the 1Bestari project, expected to expire in the middle of the calendar year 2019 (CY19), which will be retendered out.We maintain our “neutral” call on YTL for the meantime at an unchanged TP of RM1.15 a share. Key catalysts for a review of our call: i) progress in Tanjung Jati power plant project; ii) improvement in Seraya earnings; and iii) potential revival of the HSR project. — MIDF Research, April 10",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ytl-likely-be-winner-if-hsr-project-revived,"2019-05-01 20:10:03"
691,"April 04, 2019 16:38 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Gamuda’s investors discuss the nationalisation of its highways ","INVESTORS in Gamuda Bhd’s securities voiced their views on the nationalisation of the four highway concessionaires in which the contractor has stakes at a meeting with the group on March 15.According to sources with knowledge of the meeting, Gamuda’s top management attended along with representatives of Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB). CIMB Investment Bank Bhd (CIMB IB) sent representatives in its capacity as financial adviser to the government in order to provide feedback on the meeting to the Ministry of Finance (MoF).The main issue the investors raised was the methodology to be used to determine the valuation of the highway concessionaires. They were also concerned about the possible impact on the capital market if the parties involved failed to agree on a fair valuation.A source told The Edge that a representative of an investment bank that holds Gamuda’s securities said there appears to be a general lack of understanding of the capital market by the current government. “The banker expressed concern about the impact on the capital market if the government could not adhere to its rules and the sanctity of contracts. He said that if the government did not adhere to the rules of the capital market, the country’s risk premium would increase.”On the valuation methodology, most of the investors at the meeting believed that the discounted cash flow (DCF) method should be applied to the non-listed highway concessionaires owned by Gamuda. These include Syarikat Mengurus Air Banjir dan Terowong Sdn Bhd (SMART), Syarikat Penyuraian Trafik KL Barat Sdn Bhd (SPRINT) and Kesas Sdn Bhd.Another source tells The Edge that the investors do not want any departure from the DCF method, as doing so would set a bad precedent for future acquisitions.Even if the DCF model is adopted, the discount rate is another variable that may cause a heated debate. Should the discount be the yield of Malaysian Government Securities or the fixed deposit rate?Furthermore,  the estimated traffic volume growth is a key determinant of the cash flow from tolls.Meanwhile, the investors agreed that Lingkaran Trans Kota Sdn Bhd (LITRAK) should be valued based on its parent’s market value. LITRAK is a subsidiary of Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd, which is listed on Bursa Malaysia. Gamuda is the largest shareholder in Lingkaran Trans Kota with a 43.57% stake.However, the sources say that one of the investors raised the issue of the appropriate cut-off date in the calculation of the volume-weighted average market price (VWAMP) in determining LITRAK’s valuation, since its parent’s share price had fallen considerably after the general election (GE14) last year. Since May 14 last year, the counter had declined 19% to last Friday’s close of RM4.33. During the year before GE14, the highway concessionaire was trading at RM5.37 to RM6.15.“Some investors argued that the VWAMP prior to GE14 should be used. However, this is not the normal practice. Usually, the VWAMP of six months prior to the announcement of the acquisition is used to value a listed company,” says one of the sources.“Anyway, investment in quoted shares comes with its own risks, and fluctuations in market prices is one of them,” says another.The question of expropriation was also raised during the meeting, the sources say, because based on the provisions of the Concession Agreements, the government has the legal right to expropriate the highways.However, the source says that CIMB IB, which is advising the government, is committed to ensuring that this does not happen as it recognises the importance of a fair offer.“The interests of the shareholders and the government must be aligned. One of the investors even said outright that her institution would walk away from the deal if the offer was unfair,” says a source.According to the sources, questions were asked about how the government came up with the figure of RM5.3 billion in savings if the highways are nationalised. The investors wanted to know whether the projected savings would be included in the valuation.CIMB IB is said to have clarified that the RM5.3 billion represents scheduled toll hikes and should be included in the valuation, and that any savings by the government after the acquisition takes place should not affect the DCF.CIMB IB has clarified that it did not commit to ensuring the manner in which the acquisitions of the highways would take place. It also says it did not represent that the RM5.3 billion in question should be included in the valuation of the highways.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/gamudas-investors-discuss-nationalisation-its-highways,"2019-05-01 20:10:03"

Maintain neutral on respective sectors: Domestic contract awards to listed contractors totalled RM4.8 billion in 1Q19 (+20% quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q], +4% year-on-year [y-o-y]). Job awards increased healthily y-o-y mainly due to the resumption of major infrastructure projects after being reviewed by the government. To recap, project costs of light rail transit 3 (LRT3) and MRT2 were reduced by 47% (to RM16.63 billion) and 22% (to RM30.53 billion) respectively. We note that most of the contracts awarded in 1Q19 were mostly small to mid-sized ones (under RM500 million). Notable domestic contract wins during the quarter include the construction of the TNB campus (SunCon, RM781 million), construction of three blocks of apartments in Kuala Lumpur (Pesona Metro, RM409 million) and SUKE package CA2 (MRCB, RM323 million).Although we do not expect the domestic construction industry prospects to go back to where it was during the period of pre-GE14, we opine that the worst is over for the industry.Signs of recovery are: i) completion of costs review and resumption for some mega infrastructure projects; ii) revival of 121 infrastructure projects (RM13.9 billion) offered through direct negotiations and limited tenders by the previous government after cost review; iii) potential revival of the East Coast Rail Link in the near term; and iv) approval of high-impact projects under the mid-term review of the 11th Malaysia Plan such as Kulim airport (RM1.6 billion), logistics and manufacturing hub in Sidam (RM300 million) and construction of Phase 1A and 1B of the Northern Corridor Expressway (RM1.7 billion).Job flows in Peninsular Malaysia slowed down significantly post GE14. We understand that industry players are aiming for jobs in Sarawak as the state government has allocated about RM9 billion for development expenditure under state budget 2019 which is the biggest in the history of the state. Funding for those projects is expected to come from Sarawak’s state reserves (about RM31 billion) which may insulate the projects from the risk of reduction of federal government spending.Foreign contract awards amounted to RM615 million in 1Q19 (+315% q-o-q, +313% y-o-y), mostly from a marine bridge contract secured by Gamuda in Taiwan. We expect more domestic contractors to bid for foreign jobs given the continued slowdown in the domestic construction landscape.

693,"April 02, 2019 16:00 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Ekovest looks to plantations to diversify its income","EKOVEST Bhd’s acquisition of a 23.4% stake in PLS Plantations Bhd from its largest shareholder, Tan Sri Lim Kang Hoo, has raised eyebrows, given that low commodity prices currently have caused many plantation companies to suffer losses.With PLS Plantations slipping into the red as at Dec 31, 2018, some shareholders reacted negatively to the acquisition. Since the deal was announced on March 12, Ekovest’s share price has dropped by 11.86% , closing at 52 sen last Thursday.However, Lim, who is also the largest shareholder of Ekovest, believes the plantation business will one day become another valuable source of revenue for the group, reducing its dependence on government spending on infrastructure and guarding against any change in policy.“What we are planning is to diversify Ekovest’s income streams. So, let’s say if the government acquires our highway concessions, we will have this plantation business to fall back on to provide us with steady income. I think it is important for Ekovest to diversify its income streams,” he says in an exclusive interview with The Edge.The question is, can PLS Plantations become a meaningful source of income for Ekovest?To recap, Ekovest acquired the PLS Plantations stake from Lim last Monday for a total cash consideration of RM76.5 million, which works out to RM33,254 per planted hectare, which is close to the valuation of other plantation companies with a similar market capitalisation, according to the group.What is of concern, however, is that PLS Plantations is a loss-making company. It registered a net loss of RM19.4 million for the financial year ended March 31, 2016 (FY2016), RM11.5 million in FY2017 and RM5.24 million in FY2018.For the nine-month period ended Dec 31, 2018 (9MFY2019), PLS Plantations reported a net loss of RM6.72 million, compared with a net profit of RM8.27 million a year ago.At a press conference after an extraordinary general meeting to seek shareholders’ approval for the acquisition of a 70% stake in Dulai Fruit Enterprise Sdn Bhd — a downstream durian product producer — by PLS Plantations, Lim had said he was confident the company would turn around in FY2020.“Commodity prices go up and down, and we know the business well. I don’t need to be an expert to turn the business around. The profits will automatically come up when the price goes up to RM3,000 per tonne,” he tells The Edge.He firmly believes commodity prices will rise, although he is uncertain when that will be.“Whether or not prices go up, we already have more than 13,636ha that are mature with an age profile of six to seven years. A lot of money has been invested,” he says.In its financial year ended June 30, 2018 (FY2018), Ekovest recorded a net profit of RM103.6 million, a 10% decline from FY2017. This was due to a drop in profit from its construction business as the Duta-Ulu Kelang Expressway (DUKE) Phase 2 has been completed.The construction business contributed 45% to the group’s operating profit of RM372.9 million while about 30% came from the toll concessions. The property development business contributed the bulk of the remaining 25%.Apart from the slow property market, the future of Ekovest’s highway concessions is also uncertain. The Pakatan Harapan government has started negotiations with Gamuda Bhd to acquire all the highway concessions the group owns.According to Lim, Ekovest has had a few meetings with the government on the DUKE concession. The government wanted to know Ekovest’s cost for building the highway and how much was raised in bonds to finance the project.Asked whether the group will approach the government to negotiate a deal for the highway concessions, Lim says it has not come to that stage yet. “We will make a decision regarding the highway once we come to that juncture,” he adds.Ekovest has also received a letter of acceptance from Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) for improvement and beautification works under Package 2–Taman Titiwangsa for the River of Life Project (Phase 2) worth RM99.9 million.The package, which will require Ekovest to clean and beautify a 3km stretch of the Gombak River, will kick-start the multibillion-ringgit KL River City project. Ekovest is currently finalising the Package 2–Taman Titiwangsa  contract with the government.Meanwhile, in its financial year ended March 31, 2018, PLS Plantations’ operating profit was only RM741,000. It is clear the plantation group will need to produce more palm oil, timber, durian and other cash crops before it can contribute meaningfully to Ekovest’s bottom line.According to PLS Plantations’ 2018 annual report, it has two 60-year concessions to manage Ladang Hutan Ulu Sedili (LHUS) in Kota Tinggi, Johor, covering a total of 35,223ha. Of this, about 8,000ha have been planted with oil palm.Some 2,450ha are planted with various types of timber trees while durian plantations take up about 18ha. The group also has over 2,900ha in Mersing planted with oil palm, and another 716.6ha with rubber trees.Lim says PLS Plantations will expand the business by forming joint ventures with other landowners or acquiring more leases. Other cash crops as well as bee farms could also be introduced.“We look at the long-term value of the business, and we are going to expand into other agricultural products as well as cash crops, and even fish and prawns. We have contract farming for watermelon, honey, all kinds of products that we will introduce in the plantation area,” Lim explains.For starters, the acquisition of the 70% stake in Dulai will provide PLS Plantations with a guaranteed profit of RM10 million over the next three financial years. It will also expand its product range to include frozen whole durian.In a press release on the Dulai acquisition, Lim said post-acquisition, PLS Plantations aims to command a substantial share of the market for the export of downstream durian-based products, as well as expand its durian plantations to meet growing demand.Nevertheless, he admits that the plantation business requires a long gestation period before it can turn in a profit. However, he says he always takes a long-term view when it comes to running a business, as proved by his vision of the Danga Bay area in Johor.Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Sdn Bhd — a joint venture between Lim’s Credence Resources Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd and the Johor government — is the master developer of Danga Bay.“When I first got to Danga Bay over 20 years ago, the water was blacker than my trousers, and it was very smelly. Who would have believed that I would be able to transform it into a waterfront area?

Maintain hold with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM2.70: Gamuda announced that its joint venture (JV) with Taiwanese construction company Dong-Pi Construction Co Ltd had secured a construction contract for a marine bridge project from CPC Corp Taiwan, a state-owned petroleum, natural gas and gasoline company.The work will be undertaken by an unincorporated JV comprising Gamuda (70%) and Dong-Pi (30%).It involves the construction of a 1.23km marine bridge connecting a receiving terminal to a man-made island, comprising a 946m by 21.5m box girder and 284m road embankment. It also includes soil investigation, foundation, temporary bridge and working platform, coupled with environmental protection works.The contract sum is 3,954,610,508 new Taiwan dollar (about RM521.71 million). The contract period is 44 months from April 2019 and is expected to be completed by November 2022.Gamuda’s share of the contract is RM365.19 million based on the JV arrangement. Assuming a net profit margin of 7%, the contract is expected to contribute RM25.56 million to the group’s bottom line spanning across its contract period.After taking account the newly secured order book of RM365 million, the outstanding order book stands at RM10.86 billion which comprises RM9.2 billion Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 (KVMRT2), RM500 million Pan Borneo Sarawak and RM800 million worth of building works.We are positive on the new contracts as they show that the group is capable of securing overseas infrastructure construction works.We keep our earnings forecasts for financial years 2019 (FY19) and 2020 (FY20) unchanged as the work recognition would be insignificant in the initial stages as there are only four months remaining in FY19. The work falls under our order book replenishment assumption for FY20.Following the recent share rally, we opine that the TP of RM2.70 is fairly valued as it implies a 12.5 times FY19 forecast price earnings. — JF Apex Securities, March 29",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/taiwan-job-shows-gamudas-ability-get-overseas-infrastructure-work,"2019-05-01 20:10:07"

(March 28, RM2.84)
Maintain hold with a target price of RM2.70: Gamuda Bhd recorded profit after tax and minority interest (Patmi) of RM173.1 million in 2QFY19, which inched up 0.6% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) but down 22.6% year-on-year (y-o-y). 
The flat q-o-q performance was a result of better performance in the property segment mitigated by a slide in construction and concession segments. Unfavourable y-o-y performance was mainly attributed to contraction in construction margin and absence of SPLASH’s earnings under concession segment. Broadly within expectations — 6MFY19’s Patmi met 54.7% and 56% of our and consensus full-year earnings forecast respectively. It is broadly in line with our expectations as we expect softer earnings in 2HFY19 given continuous margin contraction in the construction segment.Profit before tax (PBT) decreased 2.3% q-o-q and 16.4% y-o-y at RM93.2 million in 2QFY19, backed by a revenue of RM1,122 million (+8.7% q-o-q and +5.7% y-o-y). The lower margin was due to cost rationalisation imposed by the government. Nevertheless, the margin is expected to deteriorate further in future. Overall, 6MFY19’s PBT tumbled 16.1% y-o-y to RM191.6 million.The order book includes RM9.2 billion Klang Valley mass rapid transit line 2 (KVMRT2), RM500 million Pan Borneo Sarawak, and RM800 million of building work. Out of the building work secured are Rumah Selangorku (using industry building system method), building work for IOI Corp and infrastructure work for Pemodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB).East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) regained traction following government’s effort to renegotiate with China and most likely to be rolled out in a month’s time. We learnt that Gamuda plans to tender if the project is rebooted. Nevertheless, the group is still tendering for other local jobs, on an open tender basis. Once getting the final approval, SRS consortium (Project deliver partner [PDP] of the project, in which Gamuda has a 60% interest) would begin detailed design. We understand that tender calling, evaluation and awards are likely to take another year. Therefore, initial contract awards probably by late 2020. Nevertheless, we also learnt that funding remains a challenge for the project as it takes at least four years to monetise a reclaimed land by the state. As such, the state is trying to get bridge-financing from the federal government. In the meantime, the PDP also assists in getting bridge-financing in order to kick start the project.Pre-sales achieved was mainly driven by oversea projects, like the Celadon City and Gamuda City in Vietnam. Local and oversea sales mix were roughly 40% and 60% respectively. Moving forward, Gamuda expects Gamuda Cove, Gamuda Gardens and Twentyfive.7 to drive domestic sales in coming quarters. Meanwhile, overseas sales continue to be driven by the Vietnam project. — JF Apex Securities, March 28",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/gamudas-overseas-sales-seen-be-driven-vietnam-projects,"2019-05-01 20:10:07"

Occupying a 76.16-acre tract along the Nilai-KLIA Highway, the RM356 million Suria Industrial Park will comprise 42 units of 2½ to 4-storey shopoffices, 13 one-storey terraced factories, 20 semi-detached factories, 14 lots of industrial land and two lots of commercial land.All of the shopoffices will have main-road frontage. The built-ups of the intermediate units will be 5,382 sq ft and end-lot units will be 6,342 sq ft. There will be two 4-storey corner units with built-ups of 14,688 sq ft and 15,568 sq ft. Each will have a passenger lift.The built-ups of the semi-detached factories will be 15,000 sq ft (intermediate units) and 14,180 to 17,360 sq ft (corner units). A standard intermediate unit will have a 1½-floor factory area and 3-floor office area. The office area will have a passenger lift.The built-ups of the terraced factories will be about 1,040 sq ft.The tentative selling price for a 3-storey intermediate shopoffice starts at RM1.9 million, an intermediate semi-detached factory will be RM4.5 million and a terraced factory RM290,000. The vacant industrial land is on sale for RM85 psf and commercial land is RM150 psf.According to Clarion Properties director Yap Kok Guan, the most important thing for commercial shopoffices is accessibility.“We have the approval to do a signalised T-junction so traffic from both directions can enter and leave the project with ease. Ease of access is one of the factors that will determine the success of the shopoffices,” he says.Currently, the developer is focused on selling the shopoffices and ready-built factories. However, Yap says that if there is interest in the vacant lots, the company will sell them.“But we may retain some. We would build a factory and sell both the building and the land together to improve our profitability,” he says.The development is accessible via the North-South Expressway Central Link, New Klang Valley Expressway, North-South Expressway and Maju Expressway. Excellent locationSuria Industrial Park will be located next to the upcoming KLIA Aeropolis and other prominent landmarks in a 5km radius, including the Hartalega Holdings Bhd’s Next Generation Integrated Glove Manufacturing Complex and Gamuda Bhd’s industrialised building system factory, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), and klia2. The Digital Free Trade Zone is  7km to 8km away.There will be a lot of spillover benefits, says Yap. One example is Hartalega. The company is still looking to expand its operations even though the factory occupies 110 acres.“There are many suppliers who service Hartalega and they may be located quite far away. When we open up our development, they will be able to move closer to their main client,” he says.He points out that the master plan of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd’s (MAHB) KLIA Aeropolis comprises only commercial components so far.“They [MAHB] have been quiet for some time but last year, they talked about pushing their development. If they start to push it and, again, because of our proximity — we are actually next to them — there will be potential spillover and people will start to look at neighbouring land and industrial properties.”With the growth of e-commerce, Yap believes the need for warehousing and distribution facilities will grow, and the location of Suria Industrial Park is strategic.The industrial park’s proximity to the airport will help warehousing firms save on transport costs and airport charges and avoid traffic congestion. “Many warehousing firms would want to look here because when a plane lands, the cargo must be removed immediately because of high airport charges. As our development is close by, they can straightaway put the cargo in their warehouse and then plan the distribution,” Yap says.For export, he says, warehousing firms will be able to time their schedules closely to the departure of cargo planes and load their goods without any additional charges.Yap says that Clarion Properties has received a number of enquiries from big warehouse players.“We are aware that even though we are zoned for industry, we may not attract heavy industry because of the proximity to the airport. But medium-sized industries and warehousing firms will have a lot of interest here. In addition, we are not so concerned about attracting heavy industry because we do not have many lots to offer them.” Clarion Properties and its future plansClarion Properties was incorporated in 2006 by four people — Yap, Datuk Chong Boon Weng, Datuk Vincent Tang and Tom Ek.Taman Suria Tropika in Seri Kembangan was the developer’s first project, but its role was as project manager. Yap explains that the company made an arrangement with the landowner to plan and build the development. “In a way, we were the developer as we played that role by planning the whole project and obtaining the approvals. But our official role was as project manager.”From 2007 to 2015, Clarion Properties focused on Taman Suria Tropika, which comprises 256 terraced houses, 89 apartments, 18 shopoffices and a 5-storey office building. The gross development value was in excess of RM150 million.Subsequently, the same group of shareholders incorporated Hectare Heights Development Sdn Bhd and launched the 92-acre Taman Suria Warisan — a township in Sepang, Selangor.Yap says Clarion Properties and Hectare Heights are separate companies with common shareholders. Hectare Heights is focused on developing Taman Suria Warisan and Clarion Properties on Suria Industrial Park.Taman Suria Warisan, he says, is mainly residential although there are two parcels with commercial status. “If the opportunity permits, we plan to build serviced apartments. We are concentrating more on residential. Even though there is commercial, it will be for dwelling purposes.”The township is divided into three phases. Phase 1 comprises 133 landed homes and it is completed.Phase 2 has been divided into four sub-phases because the market is slow, says Yap. “We don’t want to overbuild. We just want sufficient [properties] to sell.”The first sub-phase, comprising 72 landed homes, was launched in June last year and is more than 40% sold. It is slated for completion this November.The second sub-phase will comprise 257 units of Rumah SelangorKu with built-ups of 1,000 sq ft, which will sell for RM232,000. Yap says the advertising permit has been granted and the launch will be soon.Sub-phases 3 and 4 will be landed homes and planning will begin after the delivery of Sub-phase 1.For now, the group is focusing on Suria Industrial Park and Taman Suria Warisan.“We are quite conservative and prudent and we are aware that we have limited resources. We do not want to be too aggressive in the present market conditions as things are still not very clear. So, we want to do what we can manage,” says Yap.As the two companies are already familiar with the authorities in Sepang, he says, they do not have plans to move outside of this area for the time being.Going forward, the shareholders have the option to use Hectare Heights for residential developments and Clarion Properties for industrial developments.“As a non-listed private enterprise, there is no requirement for us to do any merger or consolidation yet. We will probably look into that if the need arises. For the time being, we are comfortable with the present structure,” says Yap.He says the two companies will concentrate on the present two projects as they want to deliver the best product and build a good name for themselves in the industry.“Now, and for the next two to three years, is not the time for us to be aggressive and ambitious ... We just want to do what we can and do a good job. Then, buyers will be singing our praises,” he says.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/clarion-properties-launch-suria-industrial-park,"2019-05-01 20:10:11"

The group said its overseas projects in Vietnam, Singapore and Australia now represent two thirds of its total property sales.In Malaysia, the group will be launching more landed and high-rise residential components within the next six months.For the expressway division, it said traffic volumes have been stable and resilient and that the group is currently in talks with the Government in relation to the proposed acquisition of all four tolled expressways under Gamuda.Gamuda shares slipped 4 sen or 1.41% to close at RM2.80 today, giving it a market capitalisation of RM6.91 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/gamuda-net-profit-falls-23-2q-following-splash-sale,"2019-05-01 20:10:13"

Maintain underweight: We believe the proposed takeover of four highways under Gamuda Bhd by the government will be on a willing buyer-willing seller basis and it is unlikely the government would exercise the expropriation clause in the concession agreements, thus executing a hostile takeover of the highways. If the offer is perceived to be detrimental to Gamuda and Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd (Litrak) shareholders, they can vote against and reject the proposed offer in general meetings. 
We maintained our “sell” call on Gamuda with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM2.80 as we think the current share price has fully reflected its value. We reiterate our “buy” recommendation on Litrak with an unchanged TP of RM5.11. At the current share price, investors could potentially benefit from the proposed acquisition of the Damansara–Puchong Expressway (LDP) and the Sistem Penyuraian Trafik KL Barat (Sprint highway) by the government, while having the downside risk capped.Earlier, the finance minister had said the proposed acquisition of the four highway concessions from Gamuda is expected to be concluded by August 2019. Recall in a press statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Feb 23, 2019, the government announced it had commenced talks with Gamuda to negotiate the acquisition of highway concessions, in which Gamuda has a majority stake.These highways are the LDP, via a 43.6% stake in Litrak, which in turn owns a 100% stake in LDP; Sprint (30% direct stake, and via a 43.6% stake in Litrak, which in turn owns 50% of Sprint); Lebuhraya Shah Alam (Kesas) (70% stake); and Stormwater Management and Road Tunnel (Smart Tunnel) (50% stake). The highway restructuring’s salient points are upon a successful takeover of the highways, the government intends to abolish the existing toll mechanism; a “congestion charge” will be introduced whereby commuters only pay a sum equivalent to the existing toll for six hours during the “peak” period a day; during the “off-peak” period between 11pm and 5am, commuters will travel on the highways for free; at other “normal” travelling hours, commuters will enjoy discounts of up to 30% compared with the existing toll rates; and the revenue collected from the “congestion charge” will go towards operating and maintaining the highways as well as to repay borrowings.We believe the proposed takeover will be on a willing buyer-willing seller basis and it is unlikely the government would exercise the expropriation clause in the concession agreements to make a hostile takeover of the highways. Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng had said acquiring these highways will be done at a fair and reasonable price for the government. Gamuda has calmed its shareholders by clarifying the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to deliver a fair and reasonable value to its shareholders, and ensure the proposed transaction will be based on market valuation norms and practices.If Gamuda and the government could reach an agreement on the proposed acquisition of highways by the government, we believe Gamuda’s disposal of highways would still be conditional on obtaining Litrak and Gamuda shareholders’ approvals, if the proposed disposal is carried out in a single exercise. This is given that shareholders’ approval is required for transactions exceeding a percentage ratio threshold of 25%.Litrak requires at least 75% approval of those present and who vote in a general meeting as it is a major disposal. If the offer is perceived to be detrimental to Gamuda and Litrak shareholders, they can vote against and reject the proposed offer in the general meetings. This would act as a safety net if the offer is deemed unfavourable.Subject to the offer price, we think the proposed acquisition is likely a positive to the government. This is given that Shah Alam Expressway (Kesas), LDP and Sprint generate a healthy cash flow; the concessions of Kesas, LDP and Sprint are relatively near the concession expiry dates, which generally require lower acquisition considerations and have lower outstanding debts, compared with other urban highways with longer remaining concession periods; the government’s cost of funds is generally lower than corporates’ funding costs; and the operation and financing costs of these highways are likely sufficiently covered by the proposed congestion charge, with a possibility of generating a surplus to the government, on our assumption that the congestion charge is imposed on a permanent basis.We maintained our “sell” call on Gamuda with an unchanged TP of RM2.80 as we think the current share price has fully reflected its value. We reiterate our “buy” call on Litrak with an unchanged TP of RM5.11 as at the current share price, investors could potentially benefit from the proposed acquisition of the LDP and Sprint by the government, while having the downside risk capped.We maintained our “underweight” call on the construction sector as we think the valuation has run ahead of its fundamentals. In addition, the property market, where most contractors have direct or indirect exposure, remains challenging. With the recent weakness in share price performance, we upgraded our calls on Gadang Holdings Bhd from “hold” to “buy” and Eversendai Corp Bhd from “sell” to “hold”. — TA Securities, March 26",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/construction-valuation-seen-ahead-fundamentals,"2019-05-01 20:10:14"

For FY20-21F(forecast), we assume job wins of the only RM500mil annually on the back of the slowdown in the local construction market.We maintain our view that the current slowdown in the local construction industry sector is no ordinary sector cyclical downturn, but a secular change to the sector’s fundamentals, triggered by: i) a major cutback in public infrastructure spending over the medium term as the government adheres to fiscal prudence; and ii) the permanent reduction in overall margins for players in the absence of high-margin directly-negotiated government jobs, as the government observes higher standards of transparency and accountability in public procurement. — AmInvestment Bank, March 21",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/econpiles-job-wins-date-broadly-consistent-fy19-assumption,"2019-05-01 20:10:14"

Maintain underweight: The Star daily on Sunday quoted Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow that since the RM1 billion bridging loan from the federal government for the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP) was not forthcoming, the project delivery partner (PDP), SRS Consortium, would now have to source for the funds. 
However, SRS Consortium project director Szeto Wai Loong said the state should stick to the agreement in the request for proposal, which mentioned that the state would come up with RM1 billion, while the company would source for RM1.3 billion in bridging loans to kick-start the project.At this juncture, the government is still waiting for the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the Penang South Reclamation project. Approval is expected to be obtained by June. The necessary regulatory works and award of contracts would take place after the approval and actual construction would only commence a year later.While the unavailability of the RM1 billion bridging loan from the federal government is a setback, we opine that the roll-out of the PTMP would very much hinge on the approval for the Penang South Reclamation project as the proposed reclaimed land (approximately 4,500 acres or 1,821ha) would be the main source of funding for the PTMP. In addition to the required approval for the EIA, we understand that another approval from the National Physical Planning Council, which is scheduled to meet in April 2019 to debate on the PTMP, is required as well.As an option, the PDP could consider prioritising the implementation of the Bayan Lepas light rail transit (LRT) line, instead of building the LRT line and Pan Island Link 1 concurrently.While Gamuda Bhd, a leading joint-venture partner in the PDP, may potentially receive strong cash injections from the proposed disposals of toll roads under its portfolio to the government, we are reserved about whether the PDP would be willing to inject substantial additional amounts into the PTMP in view of the political uncertainties and heightened political risks after the 14th general election.We have maintained our call on the construction sector as we think valuations have run ahead of the fundamentals after the recent rally in share prices. Besides, the property market in which most of the contractors have direct or indirect exposure to remains challenging.Following the recent cancellations/postponements of megaprojects and downsizing of the mass rapid transit 2 and LRT3 projects, coupled with a slower property market, we expect competition in project tenders to intensify. Contractors may have to sacrifice some margins to secure new projects as they compete for a smaller pie of upcoming jobs.With prices of key construction materials such as cement and steel bars at depressed levels, in the event of an imbalance in the demand and supply of these construction materials that lead to price escalations, it could pose a risk of margin contraction to the existing jobs in hand.The share price of Gadang Holdings Bhd has surged 16.2% since our company update report with a “buy” recommendation and a target price (TP) of 72 sen a month ago.

Sixty units will be launched on April 20 in conjunction with the opening of the township’s new property gallery, and the rest will be launched gradually this year.“A key feature of Jovita is that all units will have a courtyard, with the flexibility to turn it into a garden or an extended dining area. Linked semidees are also known as cluster homes, whereby the units are linked to each other at two sides and every unit is a corner unit with a 10ft side garden. Unlike similar products, ours will also have a back door at the kitchen”, Lam explains.The RM162 million gated and guarded project spans across 19 acres. Typical units will have a lot size of 35ft by 70ft, with four bedrooms, five bathrooms and a utility room. In order to promote community living, the units have a gateless design.Jovita will have a choice of three layouts — Type A, B and C — with built-ups of 2,566 to 3,222 sq ft. The 2½-storey Type C units are also known as the “hero product”. The landed strata houses are selling for RM1.23 million and above.Lam says there will only be 24 Type C units, which will feature a multi-façade design and double-volume ceiling in the living room area. The units will face the township’s Central Park, which will have a jogging track, children’s playground, camping site, wetland terraces and outdoor gymnasium.More than 700 people have registered their interest in Jovita. The development targets upgraders and those staying in high-rise developments in the surrounding areas. It is suitable for multi-generational living and scheduled for completion in 2021.“In line with the overall master plan concept of Gamuda Gardens, Jovita will also be lushly enveloped by nature. Plants and trees native to the ecosystem will line the streets. There will also be pocket gardens and greenery laid across the houses. Residents of the lakeside homes will have direct secure access to the Central Park,” Lam says.“We see a gap [in the market] for linked semidees. We had offered this type of property in Jade Hills earlier and it received good response,” says Lam.“The challenge in developing this project is the perception buyers have of this place. We started developing Gamuda Gardens over two years ago and many people still think it is a bit far when it is just 15 minutes from the Damansara toll on the North-South Expressway. We are aware of this issue and have been organising events to bring in the people,” he says.“Buyers of previous phases are from different areas such as Sungai Buloh, Rawang, Kepong, Petaling Jaya and Damansara, the majority of them with families. We have already launched terraced homes, serviced apartments and shops.”Gamuda Gardens will have a 50-acre Central Park with five cascading lakes and two waterfalls and a waterfront village — Village Square — next to it with shops and a grocer’s. The leasehold township has a gross development value of RM10.1 billion.Gamuda Gardens is connected via major highways such as the North-South Expressway, Kuala Lumpur–Kuala Selangor Expressway and Guthrie Corridor Expressway, while the Kuang KTM Komuter station is 5km away.After the launch of Jovita, Gamuda Land plans to launch Joya, where typical units will have a lot size of 24ft by 65ft.

The US Federal Reserve is not expected to change interest rates given the indication from its chairman Jerome Powell of a “patient” approach to interest rate adjustments. Investors, however, will be keeping an eye out for the Fed’s balance sheet reduction programme and if the bank will announce an end to it. There will also be focus on the Fed’s dot plot — a visual representation of how many members think rates will hit a given level over the short, medium and long run — but it is possible that the chart’s release may be discontinued.It is worth noting that the US stock market has staged a strong recovery following a change in tone to a patient approach to policy rate hikes by the Fed. An unexpected outcome from the meeting would shock the market while any indication of an end to the balance sheet reduction programme might boost the US market.The Bank of England will meet on Thursday and investors are expecting the policy to remain unchanged. All eyes will also be on the European Council meeting (March 21 and 22), especially given the uncertainties surrounding Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May will request for an extension to the Brexit negotiation period known as Article 50, at the meeting.

Investors will be keen to see if there are any signs of easing for both Indonesia and Philippines after their aggressive policy hikes last year. Most economists are expecting the central banks to keep their policy rates unchanged this week while the Philippines will also see a new governor-in-chief chairing its meeting.Minutes of the Bank of Japan’s January policy meeting will be released on Wednesday.Apart from keeping tabs on the development of central banks around the world, political events in Thailand are anticipated as Thais begin polling on March 24 — the country’s first general election since a military coup five years ago.And if that is not enough, there will be plenty of economic data to digest this week.

The US’ January factory orders and durable goods orders will be released on Tuesday while its January wholesale inventories will be out Friday. Other economic data includes the UK’s inflation measures, its February advance retail sales and the eurozone’s March consumer confidence.Singapore will also be releasing its February non-oil domestic exports on Monday. Investors will pay close attention to the data given the contraction of its non-oil domestic exports for January.On the home front, the 15th Invest Malaysia Capital Market forum on Tuesday and Wednesday is a major event co-hosted by Malayan Banking Bhd and Bursa Malaysia Bhd. Given the stark difference of a lacklustre performance in the benchmark FBM KLCI and a strong performance shown by small and mid-cap players, investors will be awaiting updates from the forum. It is expected to attract over 1,000 local and regional fund managers from Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, the US and the UK, with total estimated assets under management of US$20.16 trillion (RM82.4028 trillion).Malaysia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for February will also be monitored closely after the deflation surprise last month, which is mainly due to an administrative cut in fuel prices. The January CPI data fell 0.7% year on year, the first decline since 2009. With the Lunar New Year in February, economists are expecting the inflation data to turn slightly positive. The country’s foreign reserves data as of mid-March will also be released.Meanwhile, investors will also be following up on some of the remaining companies that are releasing their financial results during the week. The notable names include Gamuda Bhd and George Kent (M) Bhd. It will be interesting to see how the results are for the companies involved in the construction sector amid uncertainties over some of the mega infrastructure projects.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/week-ahead-central-banks-meetings-spotlight,"2019-05-01 20:10:19"

The 29.8% stake in TH Heavy Engineering Bhd is an example. Urusharta Jamaah paid RM380.3 million for the block of 334.16 million shares, compared with its market value of RM10.02 million. The lowest premium is on the block of 65.51 million shares in MISC Bhd, which was transferred at RM486.53 million, or a 10.85% premium over its value of RM438.93 million at end-2018, according to the list attached to the written reply from Prime Minister Departments (PMD) to Dewan Rakyat yesterday.PMD highlighted in the reply that if prudent accounting standard was practiced by LTH in the past, the pilgrim fund would have been able to continue holding onto these assets. Its reply said the assets acquired by Urusharta can be categorised into three types: properties, a non-listed company, and public listed securities.Urusharta is a special purpose vehicle set up by the government to revive LTH’s financial health caused by the large deficit between its assets and liabilities. It is acquiring the pilgrims fund’s underperforming properties and equities in exchange for RM10 billion in non-tradable sukuk, and RM9.9 billion in Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares as part of its restructuring plan.By exchanging its RM10 billion non-performing assets for RM19.9 billion worth of sukuk and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares, it will help remove the pilgrim fund’s massive impairments on its assets.  The restructuring plan will ensure the fund will be able to make hibah distributions according to the Tabung Haji Act 1995, said PMD.PMD said overall, the assets transferred from LTH to the SPV comprises 29 properties, one company that is not public listed, and equity stake or derivatives in 106 public listed companies.“If a prudent impairment rate has been practiced previously by the old management, not at 90% level, and the provision of impairment is made on the profit and loss statements in the past years, of course, LTH will be capable of continuing to hold all of these shares,” it added.PMD pointed out that over the past few years, all of these equity losses were parked under ‘other reserves’ in LTH’s financial statements in order to continue showing high profit, and to ensure there were hibah payments every year. Consequently, this has resulted in the widening gap between its assets and liabilities.PMD said based on LTH’s audited financial statements for 2017, ‘other reserves’ shows a negative value of RM4.6 billion.Therefore, PMD said the government’s intention is to restore LTH’s financial position by taking over these losses to close the widening deficit.PMD said Urusharta Jamaah’s role now is to implement rehabilitation for these assets through warehousing strategy and restructuring, while continuing the operations of the transferred assets to maximise their recovery value.On top of that, PMD said Urusharta Jamaah will redeem all the financial instruments it issued and subscribed by LTH.The issue of LTH's asset transfers was raised by Ahmad Amzad Mohamed @ Hashim (PAS-Kuala Terengganu) yesterday, who had asked the Prime Minister to state the value of each asset (equity and property) that has been transferred to Syarikat Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd by LTH.PropertiesNon-listed CompanyDomestic equity securities",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/pms-dept-if-tabung-haji-practices-prudent-accounting-govt-wont-need-take-over-assets-premium,"2019-05-01 20:10:21"
716,"March 12, 2019 16:00 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Highway takeover could set a precedent for Malaysia ","THE planned state takeover of four Klang Valley intracity highway concessions owned by Gamuda Bhd will likely set a precedent for other cases of “expropriation” of assets in Malaysia, observers say.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) is offering to buy out the operator’s shareholders, a move that will be closely observed by the corporate sector. It is not known how the government would value the assets, and whether the discounted cash flow (DCF) method will be employed as per the concession agreements.“Will the government offer a valuation [with toll hikes] that is based on the DCF to shareholders? If they do this, the government is essentially saying that the concessions were awarded fairly, backtracking from what they have been saying all these years when they were in the opposition camp.“At the same time, if the government does not honour the concession agreements, it will paint a bad picture of Malaysia as an investment destination for both local and foreign investors. What guarantee is there that their assets will not be expropriated?” says a fund manager.According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) last Saturday, government negotiations with Gamuda regarding its acquisition of the highway concessions have begun with the aim of abolishing tolls on these roads. The four highways are Lebuhraya Damansara-Puchong (LDP), Sistem Penyuraian Trafik KL Barat (Sprint), Lebuhraya Shah Alam (Kesas) and the Stormwater Management And Road Tunnel or SMART Tunnel.The PMO added that toll charges would be differentiated based on the time of travel. For example, toll fees will be exempted during the off-peak period between 11 pm and 5 am.Some observers see this as a right step for Pakatan Harapan in fulfilling one of the promises in its election manifesto. However, the negotiations are expected to take about six months.In the meantime, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng says that the government hopes to buy the targeted highways at a reasonable price. This leads to the question on what constitutes a fair and reasonable offer?Even then, the current valuations offered by brokers have differed vastly. On the lower end of the spectrum, AmInvestment computed a valuation of RM1.95 billion based on the DCF method, at a 10% discount.Conversely, Affin Hwang Capital ascribed a valuation of RM4.78 billion — more than double AmInvestment’s — based on a revalued net asset value, at a 7.2% discount.Somewhere in the middle is UOB KayHian’s valuation of RM3.4 billion based on the DCF method, at an 8% discount rate.Gamuda’s share price reacted negatively last Monday, after The Edge broke the story of the government’s plan to “expropriate” its highway concessions. The company’s share price dropped to a low RM2.64, from its RM3.04 close on Friday (Feb 22).However, following a statement by Lim and Gamuda that talks were conducted professionally and that the proposed transaction will be based on market valuation norms and practices, its share price started to recover and ended the week at RM2.92.An executive familiar with Gamuda tells The Edge that the group is amenable to the proposal because it would be able to channel the proceeds from the sale into other projects. The group also realises that the assets could eventually be taken away if the company decides to contest the acquisitions.“Gamuda is comfortable with the DCF valuation, as per the concession agreement, which includes computing future toll hikes. However, the company might have to accept the final offer on the table,” the official says.Lim has said that Gamuda’s control of the four highways makes for easier negotiations compared with some of the other highway concessionaires, noting that the infrastructure company had also initiated the proposed takeover of its tolled roads that contribute a significant 48% of total toll collections in the country.Other major chunks of toll collections are derived from highways under PLUS Malaysia Bhd such as the North-South Expressway, the New Klang Valley Expressway, the Penang Bridge, the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link, the Butterworth-Kulim Expressway, and the North-South Expressway Central Link.Yet, the plan to acquire the highway concessionaires has prompted a number of questions about the use of public funds, especially at a time when the government’s total debt and obligations exceed RM1 trillion, or more than 80% of gross domestic product.Moreover, the move seems to be overwhelmingly beneficial to residents in the Klang Valley.“People from other states might be asking, what is in it for them? Why should the government spend billions of ringgit to reduce toll rates in the Klang Valley when Felda settlers are struggling to put food on the table due to low commodity prices?” ask an observer.Executive director of SERC Sdn Bhd Lee Heng Guie, believes that the government must have considered every aspect of the plan, including balancing the trade-off between the sustainability of its balance sheet and enhancing socioeconomic welfare. However, he opines that using tolled roads are a choice, and that people only use them if they value the improved travelling time versus the charges incurred.RHB Research Institute economist Peck Boon Soon says that the current move is more of Pakatan Harapan having to fulfil what it had promised in the run-up to last year’s 14th general election. “Otherwise, given the fiscal constraints, the money could be put to better use.”Now that the wheels have been set in motion, it is imperative for Putrajaya to ensure that whatever offer it puts on the table, the country’s standing as an investment destination will not be jeopardised.The impact on debt will depend on how the government plans to fund the acquisition, says Julia Goh, senior economist at United Overseas Bank (Malaysia) Bhd. Part of the congestion charges will, however, be used to service funding costs.“Meanwhile the debt and liability management committee under the PMO is expected to unveil plans to reduce the country’s debt levels over an 18-month period. I think this would have more of a material impact on the debt trajectory going forward,” she adds. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/highway-takeover-could-set-precedent-malaysia,"2019-05-01 20:10:21"
717,"March 11, 2019 10:18 am +08",GAMUDA,"Government contract awards expected to pick up in 2H19","Construction sector
Maintain neutral: The government’s review of public sector projects awarded in the past to reduce cost continues. But we understand that the renegotiations of contract prices for major infrastructure projects, such as Klang Valley’s mass rapid transit line 2 (MRT2), light rail transit line 3 (LRT3) and Pan Borneo Highway Sarawak, have been completed for the main contractors. 
The review has led to slow progress in certain projects such as LRT3 due to a major redesign and cut in scope of works. As a result, aggregate construction core net profit declined by 37% year-on-year (y-o-y) in fourth quarter of financial year 2018 (4Q18) due to slower progress billings.Construction companies with substantial contributions from other divisions such as property, plantation and concrete products were also adversely impacted by the weak conditions in these industries.The government’s development expenditure contracted by 19% y-o-y to RM7.6 billion in 3Q18, the lowest quarterly disbursement since 3Q15. We believe this reflects the effects of a change in government and the project reviews.We expect the government’s contract awards to pick up in 2H19 as tenders are being called in 1H19. We gather that the projects to be implemented comprise government hospitals, schools, roads, railway and water supply/distribution.Most of the contract values are likely to be smaller given the nature of the projects and the open tender basis of awards. Hence, we believe the small- to mid-sized contractors and engineering consultants (pure plays) will see more significant benefits from these projects compared to the large construction conglomerates with diversified operations.The Sarawak government is expected to award contract packages for the RM5 billion coastal highway, RM6 billion second trunk road and RM8 billion water grid phase 1 in 1H19. We believe Sarawak-based contractors and construction material suppliers, such as Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd (NR — not rated), Hock Seng Lee Bhd (NR) and KKB Engineering Bhd (NR) are potential beneficiaries.However, we believe the Sarawak government could face financial constraints to implement all these projects simultaneously, given the challenge to issue bonds or use its over RM30 billion reserves, without affecting its credit ratings on existing bonds guaranteed by the state government.Hence, the implementation of the projects is likely to be on a staggered basis.We gather that there are also many contractors bidding for the projects including Peninsular Malaysia-based contractors partnering with local Sarawak contractors and competition is stiff for the work packages.We understand that Pengurusan Asset Air Bhd (PAAB — the government’s special-purpose vehicle to own water assets) is budgeting about RM1.2 billion per annum in 2019-21 for capital expenditure to develop the water supply and distribution systems in the eight states in Malaysia that are under its purview.The federal government has also allocated RM690 million and RM590 million respectively to improve water supply and sewerage services in Budget 2019. This is positive for contractors involved in water and sewerage projects, such as Taliworks Corp Bhd (NR), Salcon Bhd (NR), Gamuda Bhd and HSS Engineers Bhd.Water pipe suppliers, such as Engtex Group Bhd (NR) YLI Holdings Bhd (NR) and Fitters Diversified Bhd (NR) are also expected to benefit from the government’s plan to roll out pipe replacement projects to reduce non-revenue water (NRW).Under the 11th Malaysia Plan, the government targets to reduce NRW to 31% by 2020 from 35% currently.We believe the proposed water tariff increases by the National Water Commission will have to be implemented in 1H19 to ensure the sustainability of the water industry and support the issuance of bonds to fund the capital expenditure required to achieve the target. However, this is seeing some resistance from certain state governments.The government is retendering the Klang Valley double-tracking (KVDT) project and it was reported that the cost could be reduced to RM3.8 billion from RM5 billion awarded earlier. Large contractors, such as Gamuda, IJM Corp Bhd and Sunway Construction Group Bhd (SCGB), and engineering consultants such as HSS are potential beneficiaries of the KVDT project.The east coast rail link (ECRL) may also be revived but at a lower cost than the initial value of RM55 billion. We understand that the government will likely decide after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s visit to China in April.If the project is revived, HSS and Lafarge Malaysia Bhd (Hold), which had won contracts, will see earnings contributions as the works resume.Local contractors will also benefit if the requirements for higher local participation are increased from the initial 30% of works to be awarded by the main contractor, China Communications Construction Co Ltd.The contractors that are vying for ECRL sub-contract works include IJM and Gabungan AQRS Bhd given their established presence in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.The impending acquisition of Gamuda’s 40%-owned Syarikat Pengeluar Air Selangor Sdn Bhd (Splash) concession for RM2.55 billion by Pengurusan Aset Air Bhd (PAAB) this month will allow the Selangor state government to restructure the water assets in the state and accelerate its capital expenditure programme to increase the water reserve margin that is close to zero currently. In 4Q18, six construction companies under our coverage reported earnings within our expectations, that is AQRS, Gamuda, IJM,  Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB), Pintaras Jaya Bhd and SCGB.Only two companies, HSS and WCT Holdings Bhd, reported earnings below our expectations. It is positive to note that the construction earnings downgrade cycle since 2017 seems to be bottoming and market expectations are aligned.The aggregate core net profit for the construction sector saw a 37% y-o-y plunge in 4Q18 due to the ongoing review of projects by the government to reduce cost. Progress billings for major infrastructure projects such as LRT3 and Pan Borneo Highway Sarawak were slow.Construction companies with property projects generally saw weaker sales and lower profit margins in 4Q18 due to the sustained weak property market conditions. WCT had to adjust its operating profit margins for ongoing construction projects, which led to a sharp decline in 4Q18.Several companies recognised impairments for company acquisitions and property stocks that led to depressed earnings or losses in 4Q18.We believe construction weighted-average core earnings per share bottomed in 2018 (-15% y-o-y) and expect a moderate rebound with growth of 9% y-o-y in 2019E and 12% y-o-y in 2020E (estimate).The high construction order book of the construction companies under our coverage provides good earnings visibility for the sector.Average construction order book/annual revenue is 4.6 times for the sector.  The current construction sector weighted-average 2019E price earnings ratio of 14 times is undemanding, considering the sector earnings are expected to rebound this year.The prospects for order book replenishment are also expected to improve in 2H19.We favour contractors that have been securing projects on an open-tender basis, which is the transparent process favoured by the new government. We remain ‘neutral’ on the sector as there are still government policy risks relating to the planned takeover of tolled highway concessions starting with those controlled by Gamuda.Our top “buys” are SCGB, AQRS and HSS, pure construction plays that will likely benefit from the pick-up in government infrastructure spending in 2H19. We also have a “buy” call on MRCB as a deep value exposure, given the sharp discount to revalued net asset value.The key upside risk is an acceleration in public infrastructure spending and the key downside risk is further cuts in spending and unfavourable terms in the renegotiation of tolled highway concessions — Affin Hwang Capital, March 8",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/government-contract-awards-expected-pick-2h19,"2019-05-01 20:10:22"

The pension fund for civil servants holds a stake in Prestariang, whose shares have lost 73% in the past year.Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been willing to revive major projects at lower cost, after canceling a swathe of them, amid efforts to curb the budget deficit. Malaysia is nearing a deal with China to reduce the scale of the US$20 billion East Coast Rail Link, and it agreed to resume a mass rail transit project after contractors MMC Corp and Gamuda Bhd cut the price tag by 22%.Representatives for Prestariang and KWAP, the country’s second-largest pension fund, declined to comment.Representatives from the finance ministry and the home affairs ministry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. KWAP proposes cutting the cost of the project, known as SKIN, by 17% to 2.89 billion ringgit, and increasing its stake in Prestariang if the project is revived, according to the people.

Globally, the expropriation of assets by governments often has a negative impact on capital markets.Last week, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin had hinted of a solution to the toll issue during a speech while campaigning for the Semenyih by-election. “It isn’t easy to solve certain problems, but we did not abandon our responsibilities. Many people criticise us for not fulfilling our manifesto pledges …  Maybe there are one or two issues such as tolls. I can’t give any statement because the minister involved will be making an announcement,” he is reported to have said last Thursday.Last Friday, Works Minister Baru Bian said a study by an independant consultant on tolled roads would be completed in May, after which a decision will be made. According to sources, the consultant is EY.An analyst familiar with highway concessions says the government is looking to break the agreements without having to fork out massive sums in compensation in this manner.“In concessions, generally there are two methods of exiting them — first, termination, and second, force majeure,” he says. Force majeure generally involves a superior force or an unforeseeable circumstance preventing someone from fulfilling a contract.“Via an expropriation, the government is seeking to limit its liability, or how much it will have to fork out as compensation,” he explains.How the government plans to do this is not known, and the impact it will have on the shareholders and bondholders of the highway concessions is not clear.As at May last year, according to RAM Ratings, there were 23 toll road operators which had issued debt paper amounting to RM52.83 billion in bonds and sukuk, excluding loan stocks. The bonds are largely held by local institutional investors and government-linked pension funds.It remains to be seen how the government plans to take over existing concessions as the construction of most highways is largely financed by debt, and the coupon and repayment schedule for these bonds are usually structured to match the cash flow from toll collection.It is also worth noting that some of the major toll concessionaires are government-linked entities. The largest is PLUS Malaysia Bhd, in which UEM Group Bhd — a wholly-owned unit of Khazanah Nasional Bhd — has a 51% stake. The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) holds the remaining 49%.PLUS holds five concessions. First, there is the 846km Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan Bhd, which has under its umbrella the North-South Expressway, New Klang Valley Expressway, Federal Highway Route 2 and Seremban-Port Dickson Highway. The other four concessions are the 63km Expressway Lingkaran Tengah Sdn Bhd, which includes the North-South Expressway Central Link; the 47km Linkedua (M) Bhd, which operates the Malaysia-Singapore Second Crossing; the 17km Konsortium Lebuh Raya Butterworth-Kulim Sdn Bhd, or known as the Butterworth-Kulim Expressway; and the 13.5km Penang Bridge Sdn Bhd.All of PLUS’ concessions end in December 2038.As at end-December 2016, PLUS had total assets of RM33.22 billion and total liabilities of RM33 billion. For its financial year ended December 2016, the group registered an after-tax profit of RM288.2 million from RM4.07 billion in revenue.Tan Sri Abu Sahid Mohamad of Maju group had put in a proposal in 2017 to take over PLUS in a deal worth more than RM30 billion.Maju Holdings Sdn Bhd is the concession holder for Maju Expressways Sdn Bhd, the highway that links Kuala Lumpur City Centre with Cyberjaya and Putrajaya. A 16.8km extension to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport will further increase the value of Maju’s highway.Projek Lintasan Kota Holdings Sdn Bhd  (Prolintas) is wholly owned by state-owned unit trust company Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and holds the concession for the Ampang-Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway (AKLEH), Guthrie Corridor Expressway (GCE), Lebuhraya Kemuning-Shah Alam (LKSA), Kajang Silk Highway (SILK), Sungai Besi-Ulu Kelang Elevated Expressway (SUKE) and Damansara-Shah Alam Elevated Expressway (DASH).The last two, SUKE and DASH, are currently under construction.The state of Prolintas’ financials is not clear but the company was said to be in the red in news reports up to 2015.Another large highway concessionaire, public listed Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd (Litrak), is 43.58% controlled by construction giant Gamuda Bhd. Coming under Litrak are the concessionaires of Lebuhraya Damansara-Puchong and the Western Kuala Lumpur Traffic Dispersal Scheme (or SPRINT Highway, which was obtained from Sistem Penyuraian Trafik Kuala Lumur Barat).For its six months ended September 2018, Litrak registered a net profit of RM115.80 million from RM258.49 million in sales. As at end-September 2018, it had cash and bank balances of RM550.54 million, and on the other side of the balance sheet, RM771.20 million in long-term borrowings and RM220 million in short-term debt commitments.There are other highways, among them, the 77km Senai-Desaru Expressway connecting Senai to Pasir Gudang and Desaru in Johor. Upgrading works on the highway have been put on hold by the government.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/newsbreak-government-may-expropriate-selected-highways,"2019-05-01 20:10:24"

Ultimately, timely and adequate payments in settlement of the concessionaire’s financial obligations are crucial towards ensuring the stability and accessibility to fund similar transactions via the debt capital market,” said Davinder.RAM rating, however, opined that GoM's proposed acquisition of four highways under Gamuda Bhd and the introduction of a congestion charge in place of the current toll regime of these highways are expected to complicate the issue of toll abolishment for the highway sector.The four highways are Lebuhraya Damansara Puchong (LDP), Sistem Penyuraian Trafik KL Barat (SPRINT), Lebuhraya Shah Alam (KESAS) and the SMART Tunnel, which covers the Klang Valley and Selangor and catering to around one million vehicles daily.From the sovereign’s budgetary perspective, the acquisition of the four tolled highways has not been budgeted for and will likely exacerbate the GoM’s debt burden, it said.RAM’s ratings on Malaysia will consider the possibility of fiscally onerous political considerations.“Nevertheless, RAM expects the GoM to be cautious in raising debt for this purpose, given its commitment to long-term fiscal consolidation,” according to RAM’s head of sovereign ratings Esther Lai.“All said, the eventual outcome of the proposed acquisitions will have to carefully balance Malaysia’s limited fiscal space, which is underscored by its elevated effective debt level, which is estimated at 65.7 per cent of GDP as at end-2018,"" according to Esther Lai.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ram-believes-government-will-strike-balance-between-tollabolition-and-implications-debt,"2019-05-01 20:10:24"

This compares with Maybank’s earlier estimate of RM2.6 billion, and Affin Hwang Capital’s estimate of RM4.78 billion.Maybank values the four toll concessions at RM4.8 billion.Credit Suisse Malaysia commented that the takeover of the highways will add to the government’s current financial burden.“Given the obligations of debt, the government has moved to defer some of its capex (capital expenditure) including, ironically, some public transport projects like MRT3 (Circle Line),” said Credit Suisse Malaysia managing director Stephen Hagger.“Yet, the government has potentially chosen to incur more debt, to buy some toll roads from Gamuda,” Hagger added, pointing to the pressure on the government to deliver on a “sugar rush” election promise that is road toll abolishments.While the government’s fiscal position is a concern, some economists view that the timing of the takeover is not wrong considering the mounting cost of living.On top of debt financing, the government could absorb some acquisition costs with ongoing sale of its assets, said Sunway University Business School economics professor Dr Yeah Kim Leng.“Overall there will be immediate impact on debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio, but the government still have room as it has not reached the self-imposed ceiling of 55%,” said Yeah.“Still, the fundraising has to be conducted without causing too sharp of a jump [in government debt] and explained carefully to credit rating agencies,” he added.There is not much difference to costs, Yeah said, whether the government conducts the takeover now or pushes the decision down the road — no more than several years — as the matter still needs to be addressed during the current electoral cycle.“In the past, privatisation has been favourable to toll concessionaires,” he added. “Perhaps we can allow the pendulum to readjust to a more equitable balance between road users and the toll operators.”The expectation is that there will be meaningful compromise in the costs for the concessions buyout, taking into account that part of these highways are owned by government-linked institutional funds such as the Employees Provident Fund.Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs research and development director Laurence Todd concurred.“However, the bigger concern is the costs of operating the roads for the years ahead,” he said.Guan Eng said in the statement that collection of the congestion charge “will be sufficient to both service the debt from the acquisition and fund the highways’ operational and maintenance costs.To recap, the government has proposed a three-tiered payment structure for the four highways moving forward, namely: 30% discount from current toll rates for normal hours, full rate for six peak hours, and free access during off-peak hours which is between 11pm and 5am.Initial projections estimate that commuters will save as much as RM180 million per annum immediately with the switch from toll to congestion charge, according to Guan Eng.“It remains to be seen [whether the quantum will be sufficient],” said Todd. “But I can’t see revenue from the reduced collection would be able to completely cover the costs.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/government-sidestep-rm53b-toll-freeze-compensation,"2019-05-01 20:10:27"

But to what degree that the negotiations will be done on a willing buyer-willing seller basis, we will have to wait for more details,” he said.The Prime Minister’s Office last Saturday issued a statement saying it has begun talks with Gamuda to negotiate the acquisition of four highway concessions that the group has majority stakes in.The four highways are Lebuhraya Damansara Puchong and Sistem Penyuraian Trafik KL Barat, which are owned by Gamuda’s 43.58%-owned Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd; 70%-owned Lebuhraya Shah Alam; and, 50%-owned Smart Tunnel.The announcement after The Edge Weekly reported in the latest issue that the government is seeking expropriation values from highway concessionaires to start its move to abolish road tolls in stages.Upon successful takeover, the highways will introduce three tiers of usage — toll-free period between 11pm and 5am, full toll charges dubbed “congestion charges” during six peak hours in a day and discounted rates of up to 30% from existing toll charges for the remaining hours.UOB Kay Hian Research analyst Vincent Khoo said Putrajaya should adhere to the exit clause based on the concession agreement to maintain the government’s integrity of governance and sanctity of contracts.“We certainly hope the government would make the acquisition offer based on the concession exit clause, and I think there is a good case for the government to do so to avoid having policies that create turmoil to the capital market.“We have already witnessed the capital market reaction from the various policy changes in 2018, whereby domestic reinvestments have fallen sharply.“Based on our surveys with most of the foreign funds, we found that they have rated Malaysia as the least attractive market to invest, and policy uncertainty is the key factor,” he said.Khoo’s valuation on the four highways is RM3.4 billion based on discounted cash flow methodology assuming a discount rate of 8%. In view of the uncertainty, he advises investors to wait on the sidelines for a clearer signal that confirms the government is engaging in arm’s length negotiation.All said, with reference to the divestment of the group’s water assets to Pengurusan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd, some quarters opine that it might not be an easy feat for Gamuda’s board to ensure that the takeovers of its toll concessions are arm’s length transactions.To recap, Gamuda has accepted a RM2.55 billion cash offer to buy its 40% stake in Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor Sdn Bhd (Splash).The offer price is a 28% discount to Splash’s net book value of RM3.54 billion as at June 30, 2018 compared with the valuation of one-time book value that Gamuda was seeking then. Nonetheless, the final offer was more appealing than the initial ones.Khoo, however, said  the toll concession acquisition is different from that of the water asset acquisition.“This is different from the water asset acquisition last year, the water issue has been dragged on for a long time, and during that time the Selangor state government was reluctant to approve the water tariff increase. But for toll, the concessionaires have the negotiation power to wait until they are satisfied with what the government offers.“There may be situation where Gamuda will receive a discounted offer, as the market has priced in today (Feb 25), but I do not foresee an exceptionally steep discount.“If so, it will dampen confidence in the capital market,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/market-valuation-norms-please-gamuda-tells-govt,"2019-05-01 20:10:33"

Meanwhile, full-year revenue came in at RM1.33 billion, up 12.3% from RM1.19 billion in the year before.Going forward, the group remains cautious but optimistic that its initiatives and strategies, together with its plans for product innovation and regional expansion, will yield positive results.UEM Edgenta Bhd’s core net profit in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 expanded 27.8% to RM69.09 million from RM54.07 million previously on lower finance costs and taxes.When including gain of disposal of a subsidiary amounting to RM274.91 million recorded in the year-ago quarter, UEM Edgenta’s net profit fell by more than two-thirds to RM67.73 million from RM324.81 million previously.Quarterly revenue fell 3.7% to RM647.35 million from RM672.31 million last year, as lower contribution from two segments — consultancy, and infra services — offset the rise in contribution from healthcare services, property and facility solutions, and property development.The group has declared a second interim dividend of eight sen per share, payable on May 9.For the full financial year (FY18), UEM Edgenta’s net profit fell 64.55% to RM148.24 million from RM418.19 million the year before, while annual revenue grew marginally by 2.92% to RM2.18 billion from RM2.12 billion previously as lower contribution from the consultancy segment was offset by higher revenue across the board.The company remains optimistic of its prospects in the infrastructure and healthcare sectors, in which it predominantly operates.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/gamuda-maybulk-apex-equity-tan-chong-karex-k-seng-seng-media-chinese-econpile-boustead,"2019-05-01 20:10:34"

They can issue sukuk or soft loans (to finance the acquisition) but in the end, the Government needs to do an in-depth study as we do not want other problems such as  maintenance and so on,” he said.Nazri Khan said the Government must also be fully committed to ensuring that there would be no leakages in its operation if they decide to nationalise the toll roads.“Whatever surplus that we get, it must be channelled back to Malaysia’s transportation development,” he said.Currently, there are 29 tolled highways in the country which are estimated to cost the Government between RM130 billion to RM145 billion, including RM52 billion in debts, if the Government wants to take over all toll concessions.The annual cost of the tolled roads is estimated to be between RM1.5 billion and RM2.5 billion.In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Gamuda said the company would carry its fiduciary duty to deliver fair and reasonable value to all its shareholders.“Gamuda has to ensure that the proposed transaction will be based on market valuation norms and practices,” it said.Meanwhile, research houses forecast that Gamuda’s earnings would be impacted if the takeover comes to fruition.Maybank Investment Bank in a research note today said based on its sensitivity analysis, the estimation for Gamuda’s 2020-2021 financial years (FY2020-2021) could be lower by 36 per cent and 43 per cent respectively after stripping out the contribution from the four highways.It estimated that the company’s earnings for FY2019 — assuming a half-year impact — may be lower by 16 per cent.MIDF Amanah Investment Bank in a separate note said the concession segment made up 41 percent of Gamuda’s FY2018 pre-tax profit, being a stable income source for the company.“Upon full acquisition, this would mean a notable loss of a stable recurring income for the group.“We believe the impact to Gamuda’s earnings is net negative, as the move will result in an earnings vacuum,” it said.Meanwhile, Public Investment Bank said with Gamuda’s highway concession assets valued at about RM5.01 billion — translating to RM2.69 billion for Gamuda’s effective stake — the company would be a cash-rich company upon completion of the deal.“Based on Gamuda’s FY2018 numbers, the company’s cash in hand stands at RM1.2 billion while total debt is about RM5.7 billion.“The group’s gearing ratio will reduce to 0.4 times from 0.54 times in the first quarter of FY2019 after receiving RM1.9 billion upfront cash payment and balance of RM650 million in nine yearly instalments from Syarikat Pengeluar Air Selangor Holdings Bhd’s (Splash) takeover sale.“This will reduce further upon completion of the proposed highway takeovers,” it added.In August last year, Splash’s shareholders accepted Air Selangor’s RM2.55 billion offer to purchase 100 percent equity in the company.Gamuda had a 40 percent stake in Splash.Maybank Investment Bank has maintained a “hold” call and target price of RM2.70 on Gamuda while MIDF has downgraded Gamuda’s valuation to “neutral” from “trading buy”, but retained its target price at RM2.89.Public Investment Bank has also downgraded Gamuda’s valuation to “neutral” from “outperform” and revised downwards its target price to RM2.75 from RM3.14 previously.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/toll-abolition-must-not-affect-infrastructure-projects-%E2%80%94-economist,"2019-05-01 20:10:34"

It’s the money from tax collected from the people... Then the roads, which must be maintained from time to time, (costs for them) will also be borne by the government and no longer by the concession companies.“This also means that some of the taxes we collected must be used to maintain the roads, depriving the government of money for other projects that are also necessary,” he said at a press conference after officiating at the launch of a Metrod Holdings Bhd plant here, today.Dr Mahathir said this in response to public criticisms after the government issued a statement on talks with Gamuda Berhad to take over four highway concessions that the company had a majority stake in, namely the Shah Alam Expressway (KESAS), Damansara-Puchong Expressway (LDP), Sprint Expressway and the Stormwater Management and Road Tunnel (SMART Tunnel).Among the criticisms were that the government did not take over the highway concession from PLUS Malaysia Bhd and for introducing ‘congestion charges’ instead of the outright abolition of tolls.According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday, the government intends to abolish the existing toll mechanism when it successfully takes over the concession of the four expressways.Based on the statement, a 'congestion charge' will be introduced where users will need to pay tolls at the existing rates for six ‘peak hours’ of the day.During the off-peak period between 11pm and 5am, usage of the expressways will be free.For other ‘normal’ times, users will enjoy a 30% discount from the existing rates.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/dr-m-asks-public-understand-costs-govt-take-over-highway-concessions,"2019-05-01 20:10:37"

750,"February 25, 2019 09:06 am +08",GAMUDA,"A toll on highway concessionaires?","KUALA LUMPUR: The spotlight is on Gamuda Bhd and its peers which own highway concessions once again as the government is working on ways to honour its promise to abolish tolls in stages.The highway concessionaires, which investors would normally seek shelter during an economic slowdown, are expected to be under selling pressure when the market opens today — a knee-jerk reaction to the news that the government is in talks with Gamuda, which holds equity stakes in four intra-city toll roads in the Klang Valley, to take over its tolled roads.On Bursa Malaysia, besides Gamuda, among the toll operators are IJM Corp Bhd, Ekovest Bhd, Taliworks Bhd and Lingkaran Trans Kota Holdings Bhd, in which Gamuda controls a 43.58% stake.The main concerns that spook investors are that the government could not afford to pay the compensation according to the exit clauses in each concession agreements considering the government’s existing fiscal position with the mountain of debts left behind by the Barisan Nasional government, said analysts.Consequently, the negotiations will not be only based on the terms agreed in the contracts earlier. Concessionaires may have to accept the valuation of the highway assets that the government has to offer. Like it or not, this is not pleasant news to shareholders of toll concessions.The Prime Minister’s Office has said talks with Gamuda is the first step taken to abolish tolls over a period of time. With that statement, other concessionaires are expected to be at the negotiating table sooner or later.The latest issue of The Edge Malaysia weekly reported that the government is currently seeking expropriation value from toll concessionaires, a step to kick-start the negotiations.There are 29 tolled highways in the country. The total cost of taking over all the toll concessions is estimated to be around RM130 billion to RM145 billion, inclusive of about RM52 billion of debts. The total annual cost of maintaining these tolled roads is roughly RM1.5 billion to RM2.5 billion.Analysts said Gamuda was the first to be approached. It could be because the concessions that it owns are nearer to expiry compared with others. It would be cheaper for the government to take over toll concessions that are near to the expiry.How the government will compensate Gamuda has become the hot topic over the weekend in the investing fraternity.Some speculate that the compensation would be based on the net present value of the future earnings in the remaining period of the concession. It is likely that the government will attach a discount rate to it to work out a sum. The discount rate will be key factor at the talks.For the debt papers and bank borrowings, analysts expect the government to refinance all the loans to get an even better interest rates. Hence, there will be another round of negotiations with creditors.“The outcome of the talks with Gamuda will set the precedent for others,” said a fund manager with a foreign insurance firm.“The government’s fiscal position aside, it is also not politically right for the government to pay too much to take over the highways … the critics may say enriching the rich, although the government should honour all contracts that have been signed,” he commented.The four highways involved in the government’s talks with Gamuda are Lebuhraya Damansara-Puchong (LDP), Sistem Penyuraian Trafik KL Barat (Sprint), Lebuhraya Shah Alam (Kesas) and the Stormwater Management And Road Tunnel (Smart Tunnel).Litrak is the concessionaire of the LDP and Sprint. Gamuda also holds a 70% equity stake in the Kesas highway while Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor owns the remaining 30%. The Smart Tunnel is jointly owned by Gamuda and MMC Corp Bhd.That said, some quarters are not as pessimistic noting that there could be some selling pressure on the tolled road operators but it should be contained.“Gamuda and other toll operators [share prices] may drop but [is] unlikely to affect the overall equity market. After all, this is not the first case for Gamuda. Prior to that, there is the water treatment asset owned by Splash (Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor Sdn Bhd),” said a foreign fund manager.He does not foresee the latest development will send shockwaves to bondholders.The government will continue “congestion charges” for eight hours when traffic is at the peak daily, and the sum collected will partly be utilised to repay borrowings.“In this case, it is unlikely to be the worst-case scenario in which the government just expropriates the assets and [there is] nothing left for the equity holders and creditors.“However, no one could rule out the risk of taking [a] haircut, it is dependent on how steep is the cut,” said the foreign fund manager, adding however that the government will not take very drastic moves that will frighten both local and foreign investors away.Besides, an industry observer said it might not be that surprising that some toll operators may want to surrender their concessionaires to the government, especially tolled roads that have traffic volume below expectations.“To some concessionaires, if the discount isn’t that steep, it might not necessarily be a raw deal for them as selling back to the government, they will be able to collect a big sum upfront rather than collecting toll over 15 or 20 years,” he said.“Furthermore, the government has been spending money to improve public transport. This will eventually remove some traffic from highways. On top of that, petrol prices could be trending higher in the future,” he added.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/toll-highway-concessionaires,"2019-05-01 20:10:48"

753,"February 19, 2019 16:00 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Cover Story: On a conservative growth path","PDMC Group group managing director Bill Tan greets us cheerfully as we arrive at the company’s headquarters in Bukit Jalil. “I kept my promise to give you an exclusive interview,” he laughs as we get ready to take his photograph.PDMC, Tan says, is conservative. The company usually funds its projects internally and buys land with cash. “This is why we cannot grow very big at the moment. But one thing is for sure, our projects are fully sold. We don’t have overhang because we don’t build a lot and we are very careful about the unit types and location.”The group’s property division — PDMC Holdings Sdn Bhd — is headed by Tan, who has almost 30 years of experience in the industry. He had founded the group with three friends in 2008.Other than property, the group is also involved in semiconductors, construction and material supply, training equipment, and robotics and machinery — businesses that are headed by his partners.Revenue contribution from each business is quite equal, says Tan, although the property division is the biggest in terms of turnover, which can amount to a few hundred million for just one project. Turnover for the other businesses, which are trading companies, is about RM30 million to RM50 million.One of Tan’s career highlights is being involved in Tabung Projek Perumahan Terbengkalai, which was set up by Bank Negara Malaysia in the 1990s to rescue projects that were abandoned during the recession in the 1980s.The funds to revive these projects were handled by auditing firms, which then appointed people like Tan to handle the technical side under a project management company (PMC).The group’s name is derived from the term PMC. “PMC is a very common term people use for an industry that runs projects. I started that when I came out on my own. However, I don’t only manage now but also develop. So I came up with the name ‘Project Development and Management Company’,” Tan explains.Being a young company, PDMC has undertaken only two projects at any one time in the past 11 years. Clearly, Tan is very cautious. “We always keep it that way so that we can manage things more effectively.”The company started with landed properties, first in Puchong, Selangor, and then in 2012, went on to high-rises, developing its first in Bandar Mahkota Cheras, Kajang. The RM95 million condominium, which was completed in 2015, comprises 222 units. Gaya Resort HomesPDMC’s second high-rise — Gaya Resort Homes in Bukit Rimau, Shah Alam — will be soft-launched on Feb 23.Located behind AEON BiG Bukit Rimau, the freehold mixed-use development occupies a 3.6-acre commercial parcel and has an estimated gross development value of RM312 million.The three-tower, 21-storey development will comprise 540 unfurnished serviced apartments and 24 shoplots on two floors of its podium.As the development has a resort theme, its design is Balinese-inspired, says Tan. Among the 44 facilities it provides residents on Level 6 are a private and family spa, resort-style pergola, artificial sand beach, mini orchard and herbal garden. There will also be a lot of children-friendly facilities, such as rock climbing, camping zone and water play equipment to encourage parents to take their children outdoors, Tan adds.From Level 7 onwards come the three towers of apartments, which boast four types of layouts.Type A has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a built-up of 751 sq ft while the 869 sq ft Type B has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.Types C and D are dual-key units and consist of 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms (1,263 sq ft), and 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms (1,462 sq ft) respectively.Only the apartments on Level 7 have extra space, and Tan calls them terraced units.“Conventionally, a transfer beam is used to carry the whole tower, and it is very thick — about 6ft to 7ft high and 3ft to 4ft wide. But now, we use something called the transfer slab, which is about 4ft tall and is neater than the transfer beam.“The slab is unable to follow the building line as it has to be a square. Thus, there will be extra space outside the building. We didn’t want to waste the space, so we are allowing our buyers to use this area as it is just outside their units,” Tan explains.He adds that the owners have a free hand in the usage of the space but under the Strata Titles Act 1985, they will not be able to build a roof or awning to cover the extra space. The selling price of the extra space, he says, is only RM150 psf.As for the shoplots, those on the ground floor will have built-ups of between 1,884 and 2,795 sq ft while those on the first floor will be smaller at 1,787 to 2,666 sq ft.Prices for the serviced apartments start at RM390,000 and the shoplots at RM679,320. The maintenance fee is 30 sen and 26 sen psf respectively. The fee is lower for the shoplots because mechanical things such as centralised air-conditioning, escalators and exhaust fans are not included, says Tan.“Under the Strata Act, the rate is cheaper for commercial units that do not require these additional things. This is to our advantage as we keep things to the minimum so that the shopowners don’t need to pay so much maintenance fees. They also don’t get to use the facilities, so they don’t have to pay the same rate as the residents,” he points out.Parking bays will be allocated to both the residents and shoplot owners. Residents get two to three bays depending on the size of the unit while first-floor shop owners are entitled to one or two and ground-floor owners three to five.According to Tan, although the land tenure is of commercial status, the serviced apartments are regulated under the Housing Development Act (HDA). Thus, the standard sales and purchase agreement is used, which is regulated by Schedule H.“Our water and electricity are charged domestic rates. Our project is exempted from commercial rates because these are regulated by Schedule H. When the Ministry of Housing and Local Government regulated serviced apartments under the HDA (Housing Development Act) a few years ago, it took some time for other agencies like Syabas and TNB to adjust. Now, they accept and agree that serviced apartments can use domestic rates,” Tan explains.He adds that there will be two joint management committees for Gaya Resort Homes — one for the serviced apartments and the other for the shoplots.There will only be three staircases to access the ground and first floors of the shoplots. The staircase area in the middle — the grand staircase — will have a small lift to service the handicapped and senior citizens.For those who purchase a unit on the ground floor and a unit directly above it, a space will be provided in a corner that could be hacked for an internal staircase.The public will be able to visit the shoplots but security will be tightly controlled. Shop owners and customers will have access to only the lower ground car park. And there will be a guardhouse behind the shoplots to cater only for residents with access cards. People without access cards will not be able to get to the serviced apartments from the shoplots.Gaya Resort Homes is accessible via many highways, such as the Shah Alam Expressway (KESAS), Kemuning-Shah Alam Highway, Federal Highway and South Klang Valley Expressway. It is just a short distance away from the Bukit Rimau interchange and Kota Kemuning interchange to KESAS.The development is near many amenities, such as hospitals (Columbia Asia Bukit Rimau), schools (Chinese Taipei School), shopping and grocery outlets (Gamuda Walk), hotels (Orange Hotel) and banks (Hong Leong Bank). For all generationsAll the serviced apartments come with a big space for dry and wet kitchens, thus freeing up the kitchen area, says Tan.“In Type A, the living room can be converted into another room by putting up a partition. This is possible because the kitchen and living room can be adjusted. The design is flexible,” he explains.The wall between the master bedroom and second bedroom of all units can be hacked, he continues, for people who do not need more than one bedroom.According to Tan, there is also space at the front of each unit. “This makes for a good design but, more importantly, you can put a shoe rack there.”Besides being children-friendly, Gaya Resort Homes is also wheelchair and senior citizen-friendly. The studios of the dual-key units in Types C and D come with features that cater for the handicapped and aged, says Tan.“The toilet is bigger so that it can accommodate a wheelchair. There will be a ramp at the toilet so that people in wheelchairs can access it easily. It will have a sliding door and the wash basin and taps will be placed lower. The shower area will have a built-in bench so that senior citizens or the handicapped can shower sitting down.”The studios will be complete with enough space for a small kitchen, dining table, refrigerator, washing machine and dryer.“Buyers can either live there or rent out the units. We provide an electrical sub-meter and if the studio is rented out, the owner can ask a wire man to put in another meter,” Tan says.He adds that the layout designs of the development are targeted at two groups of people — homeowners and upgraders. Types A and B cater for young couples or small families while the bigger units are for people who want a bigger space and have an extended family.“There aren’t many investors in Bukit Rimau, so we have to be realistic and cater for specific groups.”To date, about half the units have been booked and Tan is confident that the development will be a success. “In those days, when people wanted to buy a property, they considered three things — location, location and location. They still consider three things but these are location, price and design. The development has to be at the right location, have the right sizes and come at the right price. I believe our development is at a nice location as it is next to a highway and it is sized correctly and priced competitively.” Future plansOther than Gaya Resort Homes, PDMC will also be launching Taman Gaya Merak — a RM60 million mixed-use development in Kuala Selangor — in the first quarter of the year. It will comprise eight 3-storey shopoffices, 18 three-storey semi-detached houses and 60 three-storey terraced houses.Depending on the market, Tan says the company may launch a RM120 million gated residential project with clubhouse facilities in Bentong, Pahang. It will comprise 151 2½-storey superlink houses, 46 1½-storey semidees and 23 three-storey bungalows.PDMC has four projects in the pipeline as well. It has already obtained a development order for a 176-unit condominium called T-Residence inTemerloh, Pahang, and Tan says it may be launched next year.The other three projects will be located in Puchong, Melaka and Johor.PDMC currently owns just 54 acres of undeveloped land. “We are a small company, so we don’t have a lot [of land]. But the good thing is that our land is ready for development. These parcels are very valuable. On average, they are about RM25 psf, so 54 acres come up to RM58 million,” Tan says.“This is what I always emphasise … there is no point in having much land that is not ready for development. It is better to have a few pieces of strategically located land that can be developed anytime when the market is ready.”As the company is only 11 years old, Tan says he will need to continue to build up market confidence and publicity. “In the near future, when the time is right, we will go into bigger projects like townships. We will not remain a small boutique developer.”Minimum borrowing is Tan’s strategy to reduce risk. “As long as we have minimum borrowing, we can face any challenge. If the market collapses, we can still survive.”Moving forward, Tan will be focusing on Selangor, where the company is based, as it will be more convenient to get things done. He has identified two hot spots — Dengkil in Sepang and Kuala Selangor.“The land is cheap [there] and the houses are still very affordable. The only problem is the travelling time [to the city centre]. But there are a lot of highways now and very soon, the distance would not be an issue,” he says.The long-term plan for the company is to seek a listing on Bursa Malaysia. “The market is a little haywire, so it is not advisable now. But we have plans to consolidate our businesses and go for listing. From my experience, the property market will pick up this year or at the latest next year. By then, I think it should be a good time to look at listing again,” Tan says.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-conservative-growth-path,"2019-05-01 20:10:50"

757,"February 18, 2019 08:43 am +08",GAMUDA,"Developers in Catch-22 situation over IBS adoption","KUALA LUMPUR: Plenty has been said about the industrialised building system (IBS) in Malaysia over the years, but adoption in the private sector remains slow as developers lament they have been caught in a Catch-22 situation.For while the government is pushing for greater adoption of IBS on one hand, which requires a high start-up cost, it is also urging developers to lower property prices at the same time, in the face of the affordable housing conundrum.According to the Construction Industry Development Board, adoption in the private sector stood at 35% as at January this year, while the target set to be achieved by 2020 — which is just 10 months away — is 50%.In contrast, over 70% of government projects have adopted the system, an achievement boosted by the requirement that projects exceeding RM10 million must have a minimum IBS score of 70.Paramount Property Development Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Beh Chun Chong told The Edge Financial Daily that the key issue for developers in adopting IBS is that most developers do not have the economies of scale to effectively use the construction system, which in turn increases development cost.Country Garden Pacificview Sdn Bhd, for example, uses IBS intensively in the Forest City development and even set up its own facility for the particular project. The company, which is a unit of one of the largest developers in China, managed to complete several buildings under the development within three years — a testament to the efficiency that can be achieved with IBS.It is possible for Country Garden to take advantage of the cost and time savings due to the hundreds of thousands of units planned for the entire project. But it is a different story for smaller developments and developers.“If a developer has a standalone project on a plot of land with one or two buildings, it would be about 15% more expensive to construct the project with IBS.“On the other hand, the Malaysian residential market is facing an affordability problem currently and developers have been asked to lower their selling prices. One of the biggest cost components in developing property is the construction cost, so it would be difficult to use IBS while also keeping prices low,” said Beh.“As it is, there is a greater urgency to reduce the price of homes rather than adopting IBS, which could increase prices instead,” he added.The works ministry previously suggested that private companies bundle their projects to achieve economies of scale by collaborating with the ministry of housing and local government.Beh thinks the ministry’s suggestion might work, so Paramount is aiming to do just that going forward. While Paramount has yet to adopt IBS in its projects, Beh agreed that the system does bring benefit to the industry in terms of labour cost savings.Hence, the company is now looking at standardising the units of different developments in order to achieve economies of scale.“If we have a better grasp of what kind of units are in demand, in terms of size and specification, we can standardise our units so we could replicate similar units in different projects.“In order for IBS to be adopted in a meaningful way, early planning is needed. It needs to begin from the designing stage. As soon as a developer acquires a piece of land, they must already have IBS in mind,” Beh said.Adoption, said Beh, will definitely increase in the coming years amid the worker shortage issue. “But currently, standalone developers can’t do it yet. The cost of hiring manual labour currently is still cheaper than using IBS,” he said.MGB Bhd, which has partnered Sany Construction Industry Development (M) Sdn Bhd to set up a precast concrete plant, said the demand for IBS components and adoption has been increasing over the years, albeit at a rather slow rate.“The slow adoption is related to the high set-up cost and low demand. Industry players are still opting for conventional construction. As the cost of labour is rising, it is a good time to adopt IBS as it would require less labour.“With the increasing familiarity and demand, the cost would also be lower in the future,” said Tan Sri Lim Hock San, the group managing director of MGB as well as its parent, LBS Bina Holdings Sdn Bhd.Asked if there should be any incentives given to developers to encourage adoption, Lim said no need as he believes demand for IBS will gradually increase. Having said that, he acknowledged that incentives could speed up adoption. The key IBS driverGamuda IBS Sdn Bhd general manager Tan Ek Khai said the government’s policy of reducing reliance on foreign workers and the need to cleanse the workforce of illegal foreign workers will be the key driver of IBS adoption.Gamuda IBS currently can produce up to 10,000 IBS-built units per year following the completion of its second IBS facility in Banting last year to complement its first plant in Sepang, which has been operating since 2016.He said the use of a fully integrated digital system — combining the use of building information modelling and IBS to provide a smooth end-to-end process of property development — could reduce reliance on foreign workers by 70% and bring local Technical and Vocational Education and Training back into the industry.“This demand for IBS comes naturally when it remains the best way to build, like in Europe and Singapore. Gamuda IBS stands ready to work with all developers to realise the future of homebuilding,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/developers-catch22-situation-over-ibs-adoption,"2019-05-01 20:10:53"

The property portal has also created a dedicated website to raise awareness and educate the public about the policy and needs of PPR residents. The website www.EdgeProp.my/DKN provides a summary of DKN’s objectives, why it is needed and how the public and companies can help.The DKN, which was launched today by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, today aims to empower the B40 group and PPR communities and improve their living environment. In conjunction with the launch, Subang Jaya Municipal Council organised a Community Carnival here Edgeprop.my and the nine participating companies showcased their proposed CSR commitments to their respective PPRs. Representatives of the companies also received certificates of appreciation at the launch event.Country Garden Pacificview will be adopting two projects in Johor namely PPR Tampoi and the first phase of PPR Sungai Melana and aims to enhance the livelihood and community engagement of the residents. It plans to uplift the standard of living at the PPR projects by carrying out road building and gotong-royong activities at both sites. There are also plans to repair the playground and sports facilities at PPR Sungai Melana while at PPR Tampoi, it wants to set up a children’s daycare center.Meanwhile, Gamuda Land has started its CSR effort at PPR Lembah Subang in Petaling Jaya with mural painting and facilities upgrade activity, which aims to turn one of the communal spaces into a learning centre for the children.UEM Sunrise has set up a community library dubbed BookHub at the PPR that they adopted, which is the newly completed PPR Uda Utama in Johor. Housing a communal space in the PPR, the library, which offers about 500 books, is completed and handed over to the residents on Feb 15.Mah Sing through the Mah Sing Foundation has been carrying out a food aid programme at PPR Enggang in Selangor and education programme at Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampung Batu, where most of the students are living in PPR Batu Muda and PPR Pekan Batu in Kuala Lumpur.The foundation is also working with non-governmental organisations and relevant authorities to create community gardens within selected PPRs to offer spots of relaxation for residents and where they can try their hand at growing vegetables.Meanwhile, MKH is rolling out a Badminton Outreach Programme for PPR Lembah Subang 2 that is designed to promote healthy lifestyle among the PPR community through badminton. With the aim of ensuring long-term sustainability, the programme promotes sports leadership and social responsibility through training adults into community coaches, who will further lead training for youths within the community.Another developer Sunsuria will offer internship opportunities in jobs areas such as landscaping, general and clerical work, building maintenance and asset management, to residents of PPR projects located near the developer’s projects or offices.As for OSK Property, it is going to support the maintenance of PPR homes and promote the sense of neighbourliness among the residents at PPR Jalan Thamby in Penang. The developer will be working with the residents to carry out repainting activity at the vandalised areas in the flat and rolling out community bonding activities such as gotong royong and education programme.Sunway Group will assist residents at PPR Pudu Ulu and PPR Muhibah, Jalan Puchong through a food programme, which is expected to be rolled out in April. The integrated group has been providing food aid to the residents via the Sunway Food Programme over the past few years.To tackle the issue of cleanliness in PPR projects, an aspect of building maintenance, Henry Butcher Malaysia (Mont’Kiara) will implement a 12-month cleanliness programme which consists of gotong-royong, cleanliness awareness talks, recycling trash-to-cash programme, among other activities, at PPR Sungai Putat, Batu Berendam in Melaka starting next month.

760,"February 14, 2019 14:00 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Gamuda: Continuity of MRT projects key to retain talent ","THE continuity of mass rapid transit projects is vital for Gamuda Bhd to retain its highly skilled workforce who are trained to operate tunnel boring machines (TBMs) in difficult and complex underground geological formations, says group managing director Datuk Lin Yun Ling.Thus, the company is continuing to bid for MRT projects in the region, especially those with tunnelling portions, and is tendering for jobs in Singapore, Vietnam and Australia, Lin tells The Edge in an interview.If the Malaysian government puts the MRT3 (Circle Line) on the back burner for an unspecified period of time, Lin believes Gamuda would lose its experienced workforce as they would move to other countries for jobs.“If we don’t have continuity of projects, it would be inevitable that we would lose our people. That’s why now we are tendering in Vietnam, Singapore and Australia to expand our market. This is quite a logical natural evolution,” he says.“For instance, in Australia, for the next 10 years in Sydney and Melbourne, they are going to put over A$100 billion into railway and metro projects, so there’s a lot of tunnelling projects. I look forward to working with Herrenknecht [AG] over the next 10 years.”Herrenknecht is Gamuda’s technological partner in tunnelling in Asia-Pacific. The partnership was fostered when Gamuda and its local partner, MMC Corp Bhd, undertook the construction of the Stormwater Management and Road Tunnel (SMART Tunnel) in 2003.One of the leading TBM manufacturers and operators in the world, Herrenknecht is capable of producing TBMs with diameters of between 10cm and 17.6m. The latter, which is one of the largest TBMs in operation, is currently being deployed in Hong Kong.The partnership between Gamuda and Herrenknecht over the last 15 years culminated in the creation of a variable density TBM, with the MRT1 having the distinction of being the first in the world to deploy this cutting-edge technology.The variable density TBM came about after MMC Gamuda and Herrenknecht gained invaluable knowledge and experience from tunnelling through Kuala Lumpur’s complex geological formation during the construction of the SMART Tunnel in 2007.The variable density TBM was built to tunnel through the transition between two geological formations — the Kuala Lumpur Limestone Formation and the Kenny Hill Formation — by switching between slurry and earth pressure balance modes, according to MRT Corp.The TBM is also built for karstic limestone formations, using slurry of higher density and viscosity, and can minimise the risk of blowouts and sinkholes. MRT1 saw only one sinkhole during its construction, compared with the multiple sinkholes during the construction of the SMART Tunnel.Tunnelling through Kuala Lumpur’s complex geological formations also benefited Herrenknecht.According to its founder and chairman of the board of management, Dr Martin Herrenknecht, the experience enabled the German company to undertake similarly complex tunnelling in France and Australia.“We are trying to get into foreign countries with the experience that we have gained here in Kuala Lumpur. We want to sell to foreign countries the technology that we have proved here together with Gamuda. And the cooperation with the team they have here is excellent,” he enthuses.With Herrenknecht being the proprietary owner of the technology, did the experience mostly benefit the German company? Martin says MMC Gamuda also gained from the partnership as the experience and technological know-how have been imparted to its workers.MMC Gamuda’s highly skilled workforce gives the company the edge when it comes to tenders for tunnelling jobs overseas, he adds. With Herrenknecht as its technological partner, Gamuda is confident of securing MRT jobs abroad.“If you don’t train your people in your homeland in difficult ground conditions, you have no chance of exporting and building tunnels in Australia, or Vietnam, or Singapore,” observes Martin.Meanwhile, Lin says Malaysia lacks the industrial capacity and capability to produce TBMs as it does not have the sophisticated and advanced industrial supply chain that industrialised countries such as Germany, Japan and China boast.“We cannot produce TBMs like how they do in Germany. They manufacture the machines, from the driveshaft to the hydraulic system — all these different parts are outsourced to different suppliers. But they know how to put them together, they know how to cast them and make them better over time.”Gamuda has some experience in developing MRT projects abroad. In 2002, the company was contracted to construct 3.86km of the 43km Kaohsiung Metropolitan MRT in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The contract involved the construction of two parallel underground tunnels and two underground stations.Over time, the company has gained more experience and know-how. As the project delivery partner for KVMRT1 and now as turnkey contractor for KVMRT2, Gamuda can be expected to bid for jobs overseas that are larger than its maiden effort in Kaohsiung.Nonetheless, venturing outside Malaysia would pit it against the world’s best.Hanoi’s first MRT line is being constructed by China Railway Group Ltd while Singapore and Australia can build their own MRTs and handle the tunnelling work.“Our biggest asset is not just our staff and tunnelling crew but also the experience they have built up in the last 15 years, from the SMART Tunnel to MRT1 and now MRT2 as the turnkey contractor. That gives us a strong foundation to expand overseas.“But each market will have its own challenges and we have to know how to cope with them,” says Lin.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/gamuda-continuity-mrt-projects-key-retain-talent,"2019-05-01 20:10:55"

Also known as Sunway City, it has continued to grow over the years, with developments such as hotels, universities, colleges and hospitals by Sunway Group.Bandar Sunway has also attracted other developers that mostly took on residential projects for the growing working and student population. Cicet Asia Development Sdn Bhd is one of them.Its maiden project, Greenfield Residence @ Bandar Sunway comprises three towers. The first two blocks, Towers A and B, were launched in May 2017. It is looking to launch Tower C in the next quarter. Final towerAccording to director Tan Swee Ee, Tower C is now open for registration, following the positive response to Tower A and B.“About 87% of Towers A and B have been sold with buyers mostly from Subang, Sunway and Petaling Jaya as well as Puchong, Klang and Kuala Lumpur. Most of them are mostly owner-occupiers,” he tells City & Country.He says unique selling points include the family-­friendly design, location, pricing, connectivity and green living. The design, he reckons, is the main factor that attracts owner-occupiers.There will be a two-acre recreational garden on the facilities floor at Level 9, which features six thema­tic landscapes — aquatic cove, green belt, green oasis, central green park, energetic corridor and residential facilities. The 34 facilities include an infinity pool, Jacuzzi, wading pool, pavilion, multi-colour flower zone, hammocks, children’s playground, jogging trail, outdoor gymnasium, floating gymnasium, barbecue area and squash court.The three towers will offer 816 units on a 5.57-acre leasehold tract in PJS 8. The gross development value is RM580 million.The units come in four layouts with built-ups of 581 to 1,302 sq ft. Units larger than 1,000 sq ft will have a dual-key concept.“Our 581-sq-ft will have 1 + 1 bedrooms and the 764-sq-ft units, two bedrooms. These designs are suitable for small families. That was our intention from the beginning, to target owner-occupiers. We can see that some 30% of our buyers have small families,” Tan says.There will be 297 units in Tower C, each with one to three parking bays.Tan says the selling prices for the 242 units at Tower A started at RM398,000, rising to RM420,000 for Tower B (277 units).“The starting price for Tower C will be 5% to 10% higher upon launching. Our pricing is competitive and the project in a strategic location, surrounded by a mature area and education hubs …  this is the unique selling proposition for residents,” he says.“We plan to provide a shuttle service to various amenities such as BRT stations and the universities. The completion date for all three blocks is early 2021.”The development will also feature 23 double-volume shops in a retail podium.  These units — with average built-ups of 1,500 sq ft — will be sold in the future. The beginningCicet Asia, a unit of China-based parent Chongqing International Trade Group Co Ltd, started as a contractor in Malaysia in 1991. Tan says it is one of the pioneers from China in the local construction industry and is now “very localised” — with the team comprising all Malaysians — after for more than 20 years in the country.It has built properties for developers such as S P Setia Bhd, IOI Properties Bhd and Gamuda Bhd.“We moved into property development because there is still room for improvement in terms of property value in the country. We think we are capable of delivering quality homes and should capitalise on our strength as a contractor,” Tan says.He reckons that the biggest challenge faced by the industry is the uncertain market sentiment. However, with the new government and new policies, he believes the market will pick up soon.“Although this is our maden project, we are confident because of our experience in construction. We have worked with many developers and we know the ins and outs of the industry, so, in a way, we are not that new,” he says.“We want to deliver quality products that offer value for money, and we believe we can do it with our experience. We plan to have more projects and we are looking for land, especially in the Klang Valley.”",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cicet-asia-launch-final-tower-greenfield-residence-bandar-sunway,"2019-05-01 20:10:56"
762,"February 13, 2019 15:00 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Cover Story: 8 Stocks that could surprise in 2019","THIS year is expected to be another volatile one for the stock market with most analysts advising investors to adopt a defensive strategy. Global headwinds seen late last year are expected to build up and risks to global economic growth are only just beginning to bite amidst tighter monetary conditions and ongoing trade talks between the US and China.The concerns were also amplified by the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent downgrade of global economic growth to 3.5% for this year — its weakest pace in three years — from 3.7% last October. The downgrade was attributed to rising trade tensions, tight financial conditions, the UK’s imminent withdrawal from the European Union and an economic slowdown in China.Apart from external uncertainties, local investors also have to contend with a new government in Malaysia. An analyst with a foreign research house tells The Edge that there is too much noise coming from the Mahathir administration and most view Pakatan Harapan as a caretaker government.“Technically, if you look at Malaysia today, we have Mahathir (Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad) as the prime minister but he’s likely to retire by the end of this year maybe. The question remains as to whether Anwar (Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim) will take over from him. And if he does, will there be a change in the Cabinet? Is it going to be the same finance minister and economic minister? What about the home minister? Will there be a change in direction after that? This is made worse when ministers make contradictory statements.“So, while this interim period provides some stability, it also creates more uncertainties for the market,” he says, adding that while local fund houses have no choice but to look at the Malaysian stock market, most foreign houses will focus on other emerging markets that are also attractively priced following the sharp correction seen last year.The analyst’s comments reflect some of the views of the foreign houses. For example, Nomura Global Markets Research downgraded the Malaysian equity market to “underweight” at the beginning of this year, citing poor earnings growth prospects and higher valuation as well as a lack of major expansionary reforms so far.The government, on its part, launched the National Anti-Corruption Plan (NACP) and National Housing Policy (DRN) last month, which received a positive response.“The launch of the NACP and DRN at the start of the year reinforces the government’s commitment to reform and to address economic issues. More reforms, policies and plans are in the pipeline. However, execution and garnering a two-thirds majority in parliament to pass all the new Acts and policy amendments remain a hurdle,” UOB Malaysia’s economist Julia Goh says in a Jan 30 report.Amidst these changes, a fund manager points out that most investors are staying on the sidelines as they wait for greater clarity on reforms and policies. This explains why Malaysia is ranked the second lowest in terms of fund inflows among the four Asean markets monitored by MIDF Research. Malaysia’s benchmark index FBM KLCI is among the worst-performing indices in the region, falling 0.42% in the first month of the year.The optimists, however, will point to recent comments by US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell that the US central bank is likely to stop trimming its US$4.1 trillion balance sheet soon as well as a call for patience on further rate hikes as an indication that the monetary tightening cycle in the US that started in 2015 may come to an end.With the US and China restarting a new round of high-level trade talks last week aimed at bridging differences over China’s intellectual property and technology transfer policies, a trade deal would help calm a nervous market.But for investors with an above-average risk profile, there are money-making opportunities following last year’s decline in share prices.As Warren Buffett once said, it is wise for investors to be “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful”.For investors who are willing to take the risk amid the volatility and uncertainty, here are eight dark horses that could surprise on the upside this year, based on analysts’ calls. A comeback year for Gamuda?One of the biggest disappointments last year was the construction sector following the historic change in government. One of the first moves of the Pakatan Harapan coalition, which came into power after the general election on May 9, was to review some of the megaprojects that had been awarded by the previous administration.These included the light rail transit Line 3 (LRT3), the mass rapid transit Line 2 (MRT2), Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) and East Coast Rail Link (ECRL). These projects have been downsized, deferred or terminated.Gamuda was one of the biggest losers in the construction sector following the developments. The group’s share price fell 43.7% compared to a year ago but saw a recovery in January, gaining 21% year to date to close at RM2.76 last Thursday. The sharp decline captured the interest of investors and analysts, who viewed the selldown as overdone.Bloomberg data shows 13 out of 21 analysts calling a “buy” on Gamuda, with five recommending a “hold”, and the other three, a “sell”. The average consensus target price was RM2.93, indicating a potential return of 6.2%.Affin Hwang IB’s equity analyst Leong Chee Wei is among those who upgraded his recommendation to a “buy” following the sharp drop in the share price. In a report at the end of last year, Leong says the current core price-earnings ratio (PER) of 9 times its expected earnings for FY2019 and price-to-book (PB) ratio of 0.7 times are historically low levels while its net yield of 5.3% is attractive.At the current level, Gamuda is trading at a PER of 14 times and PB of 0.87 times.However, lower new contract procurement and a prolonged property downturn are key risks for the group, Leong says. The odds of winning still favour GentingGenting Bhd saw a sharp decline in its share price over the last one year, falling 26.1% to close at RM6.94 last Thursday after being dealt a few bad hands late last year.Weighing on the group was a gaming tax hike announced in Budget 2019, the uncompleted 20th Century Fox World theme park project, and its first quarterly net loss in 10 years due to a RM1.83 billion impairment loss on subsidiary Genting Malaysia Bhd’s investment in promissory notes issued by the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe.The string of negative developments sparked a selldown but it is worth noting that Genting has seen a recovery after hitting a one-year low of RM5.93 on Jan 4. Year to date, it has gained 13.8%. Most analysts believe the odds of winning still favour the house, as seen by the “buy” calls from 13 out of 16 analysts. Three others have a “hold” on the casino operator. The average target price (TP) for Genting is RM8.52, indicating a potential return of 22.8%.Maybank IB Research is one of the more bullish research houses with a TP of RM9.50 on Genting, which is one of its top picks for the year. The research house’s analyst Samuel Yin Shao says in his strategy report that Genting is the sole “buy” call for the gaming sector.“Despite Genting Malaysia’s recent woes, the very profitable licensing and management fees Genting charges Genting Malaysia is based on Resorts World Genting revenue and Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), which is less volatile. Coupled with stable earnings from Genting Singapore, we still forecast three-year forward Genting’s earnings CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 8%,” Yin says, adding that another positive development would be if Genting Singapore wins a Japanese casino licence in 2020. Inari a potential beneficiary of 5G deploymentInari Amertron, which provides semiconductor packaging services, is one of the technology companies that has been impacted by the slowdown in smartphone sales as well as the ongoing US-China trade war. Its share price fell 29.5% from a year ago to close at RM1.50 last Thursday.Many believe the sharp decline in Inari’s share price over the last one year presents a buying opportunity for investors who wish to ride the deployment of 5G services in the longer term.Of 18 analysts, 12 have a “buy” call on Inari while only one has recommended investors to sell. The other five have advised investors to hold onto the semiconductor player. Analysts’ consensus 12-month target price for the semiconductor company is RM1.87, indicating a potential return of 24.7%.A fund manager with a local asset management believes the outlook for Inari hinges on trade talks between the US and China, and that a positive outcome would be beneficial for the company.Ivan Yap, an analyst with Maybank Investment Bank research, says in his strategy report at the end of last year that Inari is the firm’s technology sector top buy.“Looking beyond a temporary weakness in its RF (radio frequency) division, we remain positive on Inari’s floor space expansion to 1.68 million sq ft by mid-2019, partly driven by three components wins (VSCEL, mini LEDs and health sensor for OSRAM). The recent win from OSRAM will also diversify Inari’s earnings base,” Yap says, adding that valuation for Inari at 19 times price-earnings ratio (PER) for CY2019 is still undemanding for a growth stock.In fact, investor interest has been on the rise as seen by the increase in its trading volume. In January alone, the daily trading volume for Inari averaged 19.4 million, which is about 55% higher than its one-year average volume of 12.5 million. Media Prima counting on digital strategyIt is almost unthinkable to see Media Prima as a potential outperformer, given the downward trend in its share price over the last five years. Furthermore, it has remained in the red over the last two financial years.But with its share price falling 43.4% over the past year to close at 38.5 sen last Thursday, value is emerging for investors. At this level, the media company is trading at 0.79 times its book value. In comparison, it was trading at about 1.7 times during the global financial crisis in 2008/09. It is worth noting that a turnaround could be emerging as the company saw a gain of 11.6% in January alone.This comes at a time when Media Prima surpassed global tech and social media giants Google and Facebook to become the most popular choice for mobile content among Malaysians, based on data from Comscore Mobile Metrix, a US-based media measurement and analytics company.For perspective, the digital media segment’s revenue grew 80.4% to RM64.1 million in the first nine months of its financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (9MFY2018) compared with the previous corresponding period while its segment profit jumped by more than five times to RM7.96 million in the same period. Of course, the digital media segment’s growth alone is not enough to offset the decline in Media Prima’s traditional business but recent cost-cutting measures may put the company back on track.“I don’t think Media Prima can turn profitable so soon as there may be another one-off restructuring expense for the mutual separation scheme of about RM50 million. But I do think if it can narrow its losses, value will emerge for the company,” says an analyst with a local research house. Political risks mask MyEG’s potentialMyEG Services was adversely affected by the change in government, losing more than 50% of its market value after the 14th general election (GE14). Its share price had declined 61.2% to last Thursday’s close of RM1 from May 8. On May 14, the first trading day post-GE14, MyEG tumbled 29.8% to close at RM1.81.Following the recent selldown, Bloomberg data shows all six analysts covering MyEG having a “buy” call on the e-government services provider with an average 12-month target price (TP) of RM1.91, indicating a potential return of 91%.Vincent Khoo, head of equity research at UOB Kay Hian Research, says in his January report on MyEG that the weakness in its share price is a trading opportunity as the finalisation of the foreign worker management process is seen as a potential near-term catalyst for the company.While political risks remain over concerns about whether the government will renew its concession when it is up for renewal in May 2020, it is worth noting that MyEG has maintained a strong track record in the foreign worker-related domain and still holds the first-mover advantage. MyEG also has a strong balance sheet to support its ongoing expansion overseas as its net debt-to-equity ratio stood at 0.03 times. While most analysts believe its expansion will take some time to bear fruit, it is a catalyst for the group in the longer term.“The risk is that the government will not renew its concession or new competition will eat into its market share. But given the sharp decline seen compared to a year ago, it is worth having some position to gain from the upside potential,” a fund manager with a local house tells The Edge. FGV — a story of redemptionFGV Holdings Bhd may have seen its worst back in December last year when its share price fell to its all-time low of 63.5 sen on Dec 14. Year to date, the stock has seen an impressive 39.9% return to close at RM1 last Thursday. At this level, FGV is trading at 0.77 times its book value.While it is too early to call it FGV’s story of redemption, Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali raised an important point in parliament last November when he said a major overhaul is required for the agribusiness group as its performance has a direct impact on the Federal Land Development Authority and its settlers.Indeed, from a political point of view, it is important that Pakatan Harapan ensures that FGV recovers in the coming years. Just as how the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has set up special purpose vehicle Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd to buy over the underperforming equities acquired by Lembaga Tabung Haji, the PH government is likely to help in FGV’s recovery, following the alleged mismanagement by the previous management.Last month, FGV appointed Datuk Haris Fadzilah Hassan as the group CEO, relieving Datuk Wira Azhar Abdul Hamid of his role as an interim CEO. Azhar, however, will maintain his role as chairman of FGV. There are also the appointments of Datuk Mohd Hairul Abdul Hamid as group chief financial officer, Mazri Abdul Rahim as chief human resources officer and Dr Christina Ooi Su Siang as chief procurement officer.With fresh faces in the top management, the loss-making plantation group is looking for a recovery as Azhar claimed that the worst of the impairments was over when FGV announced its financial results for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2018 (3QFY2018). Perhaps its financials for 4QFY2018, to be released this month, will offer more clues to its recovery. Sapura Energy’s RM19.4 bil order bookThe dark horse that was not to be in 2018 is looking to shrug off the overhang of its undersubscribed rights portion this year. The oil and gas support service provider’s share price continues to remain under pressure this year as investors view the underwritten shares in the undersubscribed rights portion as a cap on its upside potential.Compared with a year ago, Sapura Energy’s share price has fallen 64.9%, closing at 26.5 sen last Thursday. However, now that the rights issue has been completed — raising RM4 billion to pare down borrowings — the company’s net gearing ratio is expected to drop significantly to 0.62 times from 1.74 times.Bloomberg data shows that 12 analysts have “buy” calls on Sapura Energy while six have recommended a “hold”. Analysts’ average target price for the counter is 46 sen, which indicates a potential return of 69.8%. PublicInvest Research analyst Nurzulaikha Azali says in a report that the group has managed to secure RM9.3 billion worth of contracts in the financial year ended Jan 31, 2019 (FY2019), pushing its balance order book in hand to RM19.4 billion and surpassing the year-end balance order books in FY2017 and FY2018.It is also worth noting that Sapura Energy was selected as one of Saudi Aramco’s four new long-term agreement programme contractors late last year. Another thing that investors could take comfort in is the fact that Permodalan Nasional Bhd is now the single largest shareholder of Sapura Energy with about 40% equity interest and has reiterated that the oil and gas counter is one of its core holdings.With a stronger balance sheet and massive order book, the group could benefit from the recovery in the oil and gas industry. When Tri-Mode’s neighbour is IKEAThe integrated logistics service provider closed at 40 sen last Friday, down 32.5% from its initial public offering price of 61 sen in May last year. It probably has not been shown much love by the market since its listing because of the overall weak sentiment in the equity market and diminished interest in logistics players, which are facing margin pressure amid growing competition. This is despite the country’s robust e-commerce growth expectations.Nonetheless, Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau believes the decline in Tri-Mode System (M) Bhd’s share price presents investors with an opportunity to buy into a logistics company with a warehouse and distribution hub next to IKEA’s regional distribution and supply chain hub in the Pulau Indah Industrial Park. IKEA is the world’s largest furniture retailer.“Tri-Mode’s growth catalyst is its new warehouse and distribution hub, which is in the vicinity of IKEA’s regional distribution and supply chain hub — its third largest distribution centre in the world with a RM908 million investment,” Lau tells The Edge.The ACE Market-listed group’s new warehouse and distribution hub occupies 12 acres in the industrial park and will help consolidate its business operations and develop new warehouse infrastructure of more than 91,000 sq ft.Lau also notes that Tri-Mode’s recently launched e-commerce logistics platform to cater for inbound courier services — HiClicks Malaysia — could grab a slice of the e-commerce business without major investment.“The group is also in a net cash position and has indicated a dividend policy of 30%, which translates into a yield of 3.8%,” he says.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-8-stocks-could-surprise-2019,"2019-05-01 20:10:56"

(Jan 28, RM2.68)
Under review with an unchanged target price of RM2.80: We recently visited Gamuda Cove Experience Gallery in USJ Taipan, Subang Jaya. With an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM20 billion and more than 23,000 residential units to be developed over a period of 20 years, the township is expected to be a key contributor to Gamuda Bhd’s property development division in the medium to long term.The first three phases, comprising some 2,000 residential units, have an estimated GDV of RM1.5 billion.The first phase of Gamuda Cove, consisting of 490 units of landed property, with an indicative GDV of RM455 million, is slated to be officially launched in February 2019. This will be followed by the launch of three blocks of serviced apartments (972 units in total) in mid-2019, and subsequently 525 units of higher-end landed properties.Recall, Gamuda entered into a share sale agreement at end-July 2014 to acquire the entire equity interest in Salak Land Development Sdn Bhd, the landowner of 619ha of the leasehold land for a total cash consideration of RM784.3 million. The acquisition was completed on March 9, 2015.With total land size of 1,530 acres (619.17ha) and a potential GDV of RM20 billion, Gamuda Cove makes up about 47% and 35% of Gamuda’s total unsold land banks and total remaining GDV. It is expected to be a key contributor to Gamuda’s property division in the medium to long term. For the near term, management is targeting RM380 million in property sales for financial year 2019.Despite the current challenging property market, we believe the project should be reasonably well-received, given the differentiation strategy, good connectivity and being a rare township development adjacent to a few thousand acres of flora and fauna nature surrounding. — TA Securities Research, Jan 28",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/gamuda-cove-seen-key-contributor-gamudas-property-division,"2019-05-01 20:10:58"

This was only the 19th time over the last 52 weeks that the index has recorded a gain during a trading week.Despite this, the market is expected to remain volatile on the back of tighter monetary policy and a possible weaker economic outlook for the first half of the year, JF Apex Securities head of research Lee Chung Cheng tells The Edge.“It has been a good week for traders and investors but I think it is still too early to expect a sustained uptrend in the small cap space. Part of it is the liquidity issues, which could be worse in the event of a negative development on the external front. We still believe that small cap players are set for a recovery after the sharp decline and valuation is at a depressed level as well,” he explains. Some of his top picks include VS Industry Bhd and QL Resources Bhd.The strong gain over the week was in line with the recovery in the global markets as sentiment improved following the conclusion of the US-China mid-level trade negotiations in Beijing. The world’s two largest economies are seen to be making progress as they move forward on a trade deal.The meetings are the first face-to-face talks between the two countries since US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed last December to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has roiled global financial markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index chalked up four consecutive days of gain, closing at 23,879.12 points last Wednesday — 5.3% higher than its close of 22,686.22 the previous Thursday.The S&P 500 Index was up 5.6% to 2,584.96 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 7.6% to 6,957.077 over the same period. At home, the local benchmark, FBM KLCI, was up 0.5% over the week to close at 1,678.88 points last Thursday.The recovery has led to a positive momentum in the broader market as seen by the change of direction of the FBM Small Cap Index.

He recommends accumulating on weakness stocks with a solid value proposition.Some of his top picks in the small and mid-cap space include Gamuda Bhd, Kellington Group Bhd, Vizione Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Building Society Bhd (MBSB), Straits Inter Logistics Bhd and Perak Transit Bhd.MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman believes the sharp increase in the small cap index is a reflection of its underperformance over the past few years. It comes on the back of a massive 35% loss last year, much worse than the 5% and 10% decline recorded by the FBM KLCI and FBM Emas Index respectively, he says.From 2015 to 2018, while the two benchmarks have seen small gains, the small cap index has fallen 24%, he points out. “So, in other words, while small and mid-cap stocks have seen gains this year, they still have a lot to catch up.”He adds that the construction, technology, plantation and property sectors could be where the outperformers may come from as their share prices could rise higher than their big-cap competitors.UOB Kay Hian Malaysia’s head of research, Vincent Khoo, on the other hand, believes the week’s gain was only a relief rally and expects market risk aversion to rise again, which would likely see many companies ceding some of their year-to-date gains.“We foresee small caps sustaining only a modest recovery at best. Key themes include trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) diversion benefiting Malaysia, arising from the US-China trade tension, and structural demand growth in the technology sector, arising from 5G introduction, Internet of Things, and Industry 4.0,” he says. The key export-driven beneficiary is the semiconductor-related sector, he adds.Khoo’s concerns include global liquidity contraction and the full economic impact of Pakatan Harapan’s socialistic policies, which are likely to deter domestic reinvestments.His top picks include Inari Amertron Bhd, Scientex Bhd and Gabungan AQRS Bhd but notes that these stocks are more suitable for investors with above-average risk profile.Pong Teng Siew, head of research at Inter Pacific Research Sdn Bhd, agrees that the positive stock performance could be a relief rally and that the small and mid-cap counters are likely to continue to be under pressure during the first quarter as investors are more cautious over the economic outlook for the year.“I think that the base case is for the market to remain lacklustre unless there is a positive development on trade talks between the US and China,” Pong says. He adds that the market has yet to price in the possibility of a US recession, which is likely if trade tension escalates further.He notes there are selective counters in the small-cap space that are worth looking at, especially those with a strong earnings record and diversified income stream. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-smallcap-stocks-see-best-week-under-new-government,"2019-05-01 20:10:59"

The objective is to empower the B40 in multiple ways.To do this more effectively, the ministry is also working with the private sector and NGOs. One of the areas of improvement identified is proper property management of their living premises.“The new government is very focussed on the B40 group. We believe that if we can improve the quality of life or standard of living of this B40 group, it will also raise the status of Malaysia to be that of a developed country. So, this is something that we want to do,” she told reporters at a media conference after the launch of a property talk show at Wisma Bernama today.“When I go down to the field and meet the B40 community, I always urge them to take care of the cleanliness of their houses and ensure the safety of the premises. Because when you want to upgrade or move to a bigger house and sell the present house, it will give you a good price,”she added.Meanwhile, EdgeProp.my is spearheading a list of companies in the private sector, mainly developers, to help contribute towards the success of the NCP.Last Friday (Jan 11), EdgeProp.my and some of the participating companies attended a meeting held at the ministry chaired by KPKT deputy secretary general (policy) Dr Mary Wong Lai Lin. Those present included representatives from Country Garden Pacificview Sdn Bhd, Gamuda Land, IOI Properties Group Bhd, Mah Sing Group Bhd, MKH Bhd, OSK Property, Paramount Property, SunSuria and Henry Butcher Malaysia (Mont’Kiara) who shared ideas on how they could improve the lives of the B40 group.“The NCP is one of KPKT’s initiatives to create a sustainable generation and community with the involvement of all parties,” Zuraida told EdgeProp.my.“It is important to ensure that the mission is successful; the government, public and the private sectors work together for the development of society.“This includes empowering communities with noble values and strengthening the spirit of unity among the populations within a community,” she added.The seven main clusters of the NCP are infrastructure and maintenance; cleanliness, environment and health; safety; education, awareness and skills; caring for the needy, elderly, women, children and disabled; social services; entrepreneurship and social business; and sports and recreation.This story first appeared in the EdgeProp.my pullout on Jan 18, 2019.

769,"January 16, 2019 15:00 pm +08",GAMUDA,"Analysts bullish on water infrastructure players ","WITH the consolidation of the water industry in Selangor almost complete, the question on investors’ minds is whether it is time to take another look at water infrastructure players that are listed on Bursa Malaysia.This is because the upgrading of pipelines and other water distribution infrastructure is crucial to ensure water security and sufficiency in the state, which also supplies water to Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, the country’s administrative centre.When asked whether the government would increase spending on water infrastructure, Affin Hwang Capital analyst Loong Chee Wei says he believes so, as not doing so would mean a severe water shortage should there be a drought. “It will be more urgent to upgrade the whole water infrastructure because in Selangor, water reserve margins are almost at zero. If there is a drought, there will be a water shortage.“They [the government] need to upgrade water infrastructure on the capacity side (water treatment plants) as well as distribution to ensure water supply security in the Klang Valley. Many of our pipes are leaking, with some of them being over a century old.”Based on analysts’ calls, it seems that many are bullish on the prospects of the water infrastructure players they cover.Analysts covering Taliworks Corp Bhd, HSS Engineers Bhd and Ranhill Holdings Bhd have only “buy” calls on the counters.In addition, Gamuda Bhd, KKB Engineering Bhd, Hock Seng Lee Bhd, Engtex Group Bhd, Salcon Bhd and Ranhill Holdings could also be “in play” for the water infrastructure development story.Each of these companies has at least a 9% potential return over the next 12 months, according to the analysts.Taliworks is projected to have a potential return of 34.2% over the next 12 months while Ranhill has a potential return of 9.2%, based on last Thursday’s closing prices.There are two different themes that will drive investments in water distribution infrastructure. The first is the upgrading of ageing water distribution infrastructure in the Klang Valley to reduce non-revenue water (NRW) and increase water reserve margins.The completion of the acquisition of Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor Sdn Bhd (SPLASH) by Pengurusan Air Selangor Bhd by the end of February will allow investments to be channelled to upgrading water infrastructure in the state.An Air Selangor spokesman declined to comment how much will be invested to upgrade and maintain water infrastructure assets in the state this year. However, previous reports suggest that Air Selangor will invest almost RM1 billion over the next three years to replace water pipes as part of its efforts to reduce NRW to 28% by 2020 from the current 35.2%.While Pengurusan Aset Air Bhd (PAAB), a federal government agency, will own the water assets in Selangor, Air Selangor will be the operator of the assets. Air Selangor will inform PAAB how much investment is needed to ensure sufficient water supply in the state.The Selangor government has allocated RM223.35 million for water supply infrastructure development in its 2019 budget, of which RM130 million will be utilised for the construction of the Labohan Dagang Phase 1 water treatment plant and RM25 million for Labohan Dagang Phase 2 and a detailed study on the development of a water treatment plant in Rasau.When the Labohan Dagang treatment plant is completed, it will have a capacity to supply up to 400 million litres of water per day (MLD) to the district of Kuala Langat. This is in addition to supply capacity of about 7,000 MLD in the state.Analysts believe PAAB will be able to raise financing by issuing government-­guaranteed bonds to fund the development of water supply and distribution assets in the country. In March last year, PAAB said that it had the capability to finance up to RM40 billion worth of investments.However, with a new administration, it is unclear whether the government has the appetite to allow PAAB to issue bonds because of the huge obligations it is already shouldering.PAAB’s website shows that it has called for bids for three water pipe-laying works in Johor and Selangor. The jobs in Selangor are related to the Langat 2 water treatment plant. The value of the contracts are unknown.The second theme on water infrastructure development is increasing water supply coverage in rural areas, especially in Kelantan, Sabah and Sarawak, which have the lowest coverage in the country.As at 2017, Kelantan had the lowest water supply coverage with only 67.7% of households covered, followed by Sabah with 79% and Sarawak with 80.4%, according to the 11th Malaysia Plan Mid-Term Review.Almost 30% of rural households in Kelantan have opted for alternative water supplies, which include water wells, tube wells and gravity feed systems, according to the report.Under Budget 2019, RM734 million of federal development expenditure has been allocated for rural water infrastructure. It is believed that PAAB, which also owns water assets in Kelantan, will also invest in developing the state’s water infrastructure. Sarawak playsIn Sarawak, the state government has tapped its large reserves of about RM30 billion to allocate RM9 billion in development expenditure in its 2019 budget, the highest in the state’s history. Some RM2.8 billion will be used to improve the state’s water grid. However, this allocation is unlikely to be fully spent this year, as often, the actual expenditure is spread over several years.Nevertheless, companies like KKB Engineering and HSL, which are based in Kuching, are said to be beneficiaries of the drive to improve Sarawak’s water supply infrastructure, especially in rural areas.An analyst with Hong Leong Investment Bank, Yip Kah Ming, says Sarawak is the place to be for construction players, including water infrastructure contractors, due to its large, self-funded development expenditure.“Job flows in the peninsula slowed down significantly following the change in federal government. We understand that industry players are aiming for jobs in Sarawak as the state government has allocated about RM9 billion for development expenditure under the state budget 2019,” Yip says in a Dec 28 report on HSL.As at last Thursday, HSL was traded at 12.8 times its trailing 12-month (T12M) earnings and 8.9 times its estimated earnings per share for its financial year 2020 (FY2020E), which is lower than KKB’s 14.5 times T12M and FY2020 price-earnings ratio.However, KKB has a strong shareholder in the state government-linked Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd (CMS), which owns 20.1% of its share base. The Sarawak Economic Development Corporation owns 5.67% of CMS.CMS’ largest shareholder is Majaharta Sdn Bhd with 12.6% equity interest, followed by the Employees Provident Fund with an 11.12% stake. Majaharta is the vehicle of Jamilah Hamidah Taib and Datuk Hajjah Hanifah Hajar Taib-Alsree, daughters of Sarawak governor Tun Abdul Taib Mahmud.If the government decides to invest more in water supply and distribution infrastructure, pipemakers such as Engtex and YLI Holdings Bhd could benefit, says Affin Hwang Capital’s Loong, apart from contractors Gamuda, Taliworks, and Salcon.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/analysts-bullish-water-infrastructure-players,"2019-05-01 20:11:00"
770,"January 14, 2019 09:22 am +08",GAMUDA,"Malaysian developers not hit by weakening Aussie dollar","KUALA LUMPUR: With the sluggish property market in Malaysia, it is not surprising to see local property players expanding their presence to other countries, notably Australia and the UK.But stepping into another country means being exposed to foreign exchange (forex) risk. Revenues and expenses in that country are not denominated in ringgit and as such are subject to currency fluctuations. Thus, any weakening of that country’s currency could result in a lower revenue upon conversion into ringgit.This is the situation now for Malaysian developers in Australia in the wake of the dropping Australian dollar. Another cause for concern is the slower property market Down Under.Among Malaysian listed property developers undertaking projects in Australia, Mulpha International Bhd stands out when it comes to revenue contribution from that country. Some RM1.15 billion, or a whopping 97.92% of its total revenue, came from its Australian projects in 2017, according to the company’s annual report for that year.Another property player, UEM Sunrise Bhd, saw RM963.89 million, or 33.2% of its total revenue contribution, come from Australia in 2017, according to its annual report.But, as noted by AmInvestment Bank analyst Thong Pak Leng in a report last Thursday, UEM Sunrise had said there were no defaults on its Melbourne apartment projects Aurora and Conservatory, and it was on track to settle the units which had been handed over.“Aurora is fully sold while Conservatory had a take-up rate of 96% as at end-December 2018,” said Thong.As for other property developers such as S P Setia Bhd, Gamuda Bhd and Sime Darby Property Bhd, their Australian contributions are relatively minimal.Kenanga Investment head of equity research Sarah Lim said that with the weakening Australian dollar, Malaysians could probably also consider buying properties there. This, she said, will boost the sales of Malaysian companies with projects in Australia, enabling them to clear their unsold units faster.“The weakened Aussie dollar may actually encourage more people to buy [properties in Australia],” Lim told The Edge Financial Daily. “But for those who [have] already [booked properties there], the question is whether they are going to complete the sale.”She explained that in Australia, buyers can pull out from a sale, adding that they would only do so if their total ringgit investment value has dropped by more than their initial deposit. They would not react badly to “short-term foreign exchange hiccups”.From the developers’ standpoint, Lim said they are not as forex-sensitive in general because the completion of the project has a longer gestation period, resulting in the forex impact to be averaged out during the period.“This could affect their cost, but this could average out year-on-year, because it takes about a minimum three to four years to complete one project,” said Lim, adding that the cost impact is difficult to see from a forex point of view and could only be seen when the project is completed.“The cost impact on the forex is very hard to determine because you don’t know when the developers have brought in or taken out the money,” said Lim.Furthermore, she noted that property developers are allowed to leave their money or earnings from their completed projects there to be deployed for their future investments, which means making them less sensitive to the volatility of the currency.Affin Hwang Capital Research senior associate director Loong Chee Wei concurred, saying the weakening Australian dollar would not be much of a concern to property developers. He said the developers will focus on selling the remaining unsold units.“They will be less aggressive in terms of launching new projects at this stage and will be focusing more on clearing the unsold inventory,” said Loong.Nonetheless, he said the weaker Australian currency means that when earnings are translated into ringgit, they will be lower.The more important impact, he said, would be if the developers could still sell the units or if the project itself is making good profits in Australian dollar. The completion of sales will be affected by the slower property market there as well as weaker selling prices, he added. Opportunity to increase land bank?The depreciating Australian dollar could also offer property developers the opportunity to increase their land bank down under.Kenanga’s Lim stressed, however, that forex is not the “main decider” for developers to build on their land bank in Australia.She noted that while Australia is seeing a slowdown in the property market, and in the Melbourne central business district, high-rise condominiums are mushrooming.“So if they want to increase their land bank, the question is can they launch fast enough,” she said.Additionally, she noted that developers, in general, do not store a lot of Australian land bank, and are “quite prudent” when it comes to land-banking there.While buying land Down Under could be cheaper for property developers currently, Affin Hwang’s Loong said the developers will still be cautious about buying new land for development as cash flow is still a challenge.He explained that the developers will complete the sale of their unsold units before looking for new land bank, unless their financial position is very strong. He added that most developers will reinvest their earnings collected from the completed projects.“At this point, unless the property developers are doing really well in Malaysia — a lot of them are stuck with inventories here — wanting to put in new money in Australia is a challenge,” said Loong.“Or if land prices drop so much, then it’s very opportunistic to buy it, and [provided that] the developers have a very strong balance sheet, which at this point, I don’t see many,” he added.Likewise, RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd senior analyst Loong Kok Wen said developers have to be really careful as the property market in Australia has slowed down and the Australian government has tightened rules for foreign property buyers, especially in restricting the mainland Chinese buyers.“It is not easy just because the Aussie dollar is cheaper now. Property developers have to be careful given that there is a slowdown in the region,” she said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysian-developers-not-hit-weakening-aussie-dollar,"2019-05-01 20:11:00"
